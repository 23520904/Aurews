    "text": "At least eight killed after car explodes near Delhi's Red Fort\n\n10 hours ago Share Save Doug Faulkner and Vikas Pandey, India editor, Delhi Share Save\n\nWatch: Verified video shows aftermath of car explosion in Delhi\n\nAt least eight people have been killed and more injured after a car exploded near Delhi's historic Red Fort, authorities have said. Delhi City police spokesperson, Sanjay Tyagi confirmed the deaths to the BBC, and said a further 20 people had suffered injuries. Police are investigating the cause of the explosion and \"exploring all possibilities\", Mr Tyagi said. Delhi Police Commissioner Satish Golcha has told reporters that the incident happened at around 18:52 local time (13:52 GMT), when a slow-moving vehicle stopped at a red light before it exploded, damaging nearby vehicles.\n\nMr Tyagi told the BBC the explosion happened in a Hyundai i20 car that was moving and carrying three people at the time. Mumbai, India's financial capital, has been put on high alert, as has the Uttar Pradesh state which borders Delhi. The blast happened near a metro station close to the Red Fort, one of Delhi's most high-profile landmarks. The Mughal fortress, which is visited by thousands of tourists every day, was built in the 17th Century and is where Indian prime ministers give their Independence Day speeches every year.\n\nRAJAT GUPTA/EPA/Shutterstock\n\nIndia's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has sent his condolences to those who lost loved ones in the blast. Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi said in a statement that the news was \"extremely heartbreaking\". The federal home minister Amit Shah said teams from India's National Security Guard, and National Investigation Agency are investigating the explosion, along with forensic experts. \"We are exploring all possibilities and will conduct a thorough investigation, taking all possibilities into account. All options will be investigated immediately and we will present the results to the public,\" he added. The minister, who visited the site of the explosion and a nearby hospital, said a meeting involving senior officials would be held on Tuesday morning. Security is being stepped up at \"sensitive religious sites, vulnerable districts and border areas\" in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, according to senior police official Amitabh Yash following the blast in neighbouring Delhi. Uttar Pradesh is home to famous sites such as the Taj Mahal and is a densely populated state.\n\nREUTERS/Stringer At least eight people died and 20 more were injured when the Hyundai i20 exploded, authorities said\n\nVeeru Sindhi, a local businessman at the site when the explosion happened, described scenes of devastation, with multiple bodies and vehicles engulfed in flames. \"I am fully shaken by what I have seen,\" he told the BBC. \"We tried to rescue people who were trapped inside the vehicles.\" One eyewitness described the aftermath of the blast as chaotic and confusing. He was just a few hundred metres away from the spot when he heard a loud explosion. \"It felt like everything stopped for a few seconds before everyone started running in all directions,\" he told the BBC. He did not go near the site but could see mangled car parts on fire and locals trying to help the injured. There has been a heavy security presence at the blast site with personnel from the Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS), the National Security Guard (NSG), and the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF). Armed officers have been seen moving towards the area as investigations continue.",

    "text": "US Senate passes deal aimed at ending longest ever government shutdown\n\n16 hours ago Share Save Ana Faguy Washington Share Save\n\nEPA US Senate Majority Leader John Thune helped negtotiate the weekend deal\n\nA deal aimed at ending the US government shutdown has passed the Senate, paving the way for the record-breaking impasse to be broken. After a weekend of negotiations in Washington, a minority of Democrats joined with Republicans and voted in favour of an agreement. The vote is a procedural first step towards passing a compromise to fund the government since it ran out of money on 1 October. It will need to clear several more hurdles - including a vote from the House of Representatives - before federal employees and services return, but it is the first serious sign of progress after 40 days of deadlock. The Senate is expected to return for further debate at 11:00 local time (16:00 GMT) on Monday.\n\nWatch: A few of the Dems who backed the GOP shutdown deal in their own words\n\nThe current shutdown is the longest on record in the US, and until this weekend it appeared that Republican and Democratic lawmakers were locked in a stalemate. Many government services have been suspended since October, and around 1.4 million federal employees are on unpaid leave or working without pay. The shutdown has had wide ranging impacts on a variety of services, including US air travel and food benefits for 41 million low-income Americans.\n\nThe agreement was negotiated between Senate Majority Leader John Thune and the White House, with Democratic senators Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, and Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats. Republicans - who hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate - needed the measure to clear a 60-vote minimum threshold. They were able to attract eight votes from the other side of the aisle, while losing just one in Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, who voted against after saying the bill would increase national debt. The deal includes an agreement for a vote in December on extending healthcare subsidies that are due to expire this year, a key issue Democrats had been holding out for concessions on.\n\nWatch: Johnson explains next steps to end shutdown\n\nDemocratic Party leaders had said that they would not lend their support to new funding for government operations until Congress addressed the subsidies that help tens of millions of Americans pay for health insurance purchased through government-run exchanges. \"I'm thankful to be able to say we have senators, both Democrats and Republicans, who are eager to get to work to address that crisis in a bipartisan way,\" Senate Majority Leader John Thune said ahead of the vote. \"We also have a president who is willing to sit down and get to work on this issue. So I'm looking forward to seeing what solutions might be brought forward.\" Thune did not say exactly what that bill would contain, which frustrated many Democrats in the House and the Senate, who argued that the Democrats who negotiated the deal did so without getting enough in return.\n\nWatch: Moment deal aimed at ending US shutdown passes\n\n\"For months and months Democrats have been fighting to get the Senate to address the healthcare crisis,\" said Chuck Schumer, the party's leader in the Senate. \"This bill does nothing to ensure that that crisis is addressed,\" he said as he confirmed he would vote against the deal. Some high-profile Democrats have been highly critical of colleagues who sided with Republicans to end the shutdown without concrete guarantees on healthcare, with California Governor Gavin Newsom calling the decision \"pathetic\". The measure also includes three appropriations bills to fund agencies like veterans affairs and agriculture, as well as a continuing resolution to finance the rest of the government until 30 January - meaning another government shutdown could be on the horizon early next year. It also includes guarantees that all federal workers will be paid for time during the shutdown, and funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) - an essential food safety net for one in eight Americans - until next September. A vote on the deal would only be the first procedural step in the new funding agreement and it would still need to be approved by the US House of Representatives, where it is likely to see its own challenges.",

    "text": "Former French president Sarkozy released from prison after three weeks\n\n10 hours ago Share Save Laura Gozzi Share Save\n\nReuters Nicolas Sarkozy arrived back at his home in the west of Paris just over an hour after a court granted his released\n\nFormer French president Nicolas Sarkozy has been released from jail, three weeks into a five-year prison term for taking part in a criminal conspiracy. He will be subject to strict judicial supervision and barred from leaving France ahead of an appeal trial due to be held next year. On 21 October, the former centre-right president, 70, was sentenced to five years for conspiring to fund his 2007 election campaign with money from late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. His legal team immediately filed a request seeking his release.\n\nWriting on social media after the release, Sarkozy said his \"energy is focused solely on the single goal of proving my innocence.\" \"The truth will prevail... The end of the story is yet to be written.\" Sarkozy's car was seen leaving La Santé prison in Paris just before 15:00 (14:00 GMT), less than an hour-and-a-half after a court agreed to his early release. Soon after, he was seen arriving at his home in western Paris. Christophe Ingrain, one of Sarkozy's lawyers, hailed his client's release as \"a step forward\" and said they would now be preparing for the appeal trial expected in March. One condition of Sarkozy's release is he does not contact any other witnesses in the so-called \"Libyan dossier\" or any justice ministry employees. During his incarceration, he was visited by Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin. The visit prompted 30 French lawyers to file a complaint against Darmanin, highlighting what they said was a conflict of interest as Darmanin was a former colleague and friend of Sarkozy's. Speaking to a court in Paris via video link on Monday morning, Sarkozy described his time in solitary confinement as \"gruelling\" and \"a nightmare\". He said he had never had the \"mad idea\" of asking Gaddafi for money and stated he would \"never admit to something I haven't done\". Sarkozy also paid tribute to prison staff who had made his time in prison \"bearable\". \"They have shown exceptional humanity,\" he said. Sarkozy's wife, the singer and model Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, and two of the former president's sons were present in the courtroom to support him.\n\nReuters Two of Sarkozy's sons, Jean and Pierre, were in court on Monday",

    "text": "Canada loses its measles-free status, with US on track to follow\n\nPublic health officials say the cases are spreading primarily in \"under-vaccinated communities\", urging people to get the MMR jab.\n\nCanada's outbreak began last October, with health officials attributing it to fewer people being vaccinated against measles.\n\nThe US, however, risks losing its status as well if it does not stop an ongoing outbreak by January. Related cases have now been reported in Utah, Arizona and South Carolina.\n\nBecause Canada is no longer deemed measles-free, the Americas region as a whole has lost its elimination status, although individually the other countries are still considered to have stamped out the disease.\n\nCanada has lost its measles elimination status, said the Pan American Health Organization (Paho) on Monday, after failing to curb an outbreak of the virus for 12 consecutive months.\n\nAt a news conference on Monday, Paho officials appealed to Canadian governments and the public to ramp up vaccinations, noting that 95% of the population needs to be immunised to stop the spread of measles.\n\n\"This loss represents a setback, but it is also reversible,\" said Dr Jarbas Barbosa, the health organisation's director.\n\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada said in its own statement that it is collaborating with Paho and regional health authorities to improve vaccine rates and strengthen data sharing.\n\nPrior to Monday, Canada had been declared measles-free for three decades. It can regain its elimination status if it can curb spread of the measles strain associated with the current outbreak for at least 12 months.\n\nThe country has reported more than 5,000 measles cases in 2025, with most of them in the provinces of Ontario and Alberta. That is three times the 1,681 cases reported in the US, despite Canada's much smaller population.\n\nThe bulk of the outbreak has been in \"under-vaccinated communities\", Canadian health officials have said.\n\nVaccination rates in Alberta, one of the provinces hit hard by the outbreak, are lower than the 95% threshold, according to provincial data.\n\nOne region, the South Zone, which includes the province's largest city of Calgary, reported only 68% of children under the age of two were immunised against measles as of 2024.\n\nThe MMR vaccine is the most effective way to fight off the dangerous virus, which can lead to pneumonia, brain swelling and death. The jabs are 97% effective and also immunise against mumps and rubella.\n\nCanadian immunologist Dawn Bowdish told the BBC that there are many reasons behind the low vaccination rates, including lack of access to general practitioners, the absence of a national vaccination registry that Canadians could use to check their immunisation status, and the spread of misinformation.\n\nShe also noted a lack of public health outreach to communities that have been hesitant or distrustful of vaccines.\n\n\"It highlights how many of our systems broke down to get us to this point,\" said Prof Bowdish of McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario.\n\n\"I hope that it will be a wake-up call to policymakers, and that it will be enough of a national embarrassment that we remedy some of those systemic issues,\" she added\n\nThe Americas is the first and only region in the world to have been declared measles-free, starting in 2016. That status was then briefly lifted after outbreaks in Venezuela and Brazil. The two countries regained elimination status in 2024, in part through coordinated vaccine efforts where millions were immunised.\n\nBut measles has since spread again, now in North America.\n\nAlong with Canada and the United States, Mexico has also seen a surge in cases and now ranks among the top 10 countries with the largest outbreaks, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",

    "text": "Malian TikToker killed by suspected jihadists after pro-army posts\n\n17 hours ago Share Save Basillioh Rukanga Share Save\n\nMariam Cissé / Tiktok The killing of Mariam Cissé has shocked the nation\n\nA female TikToker accused of helping Mali's army has been seized and killed execution-style by suspected jihadists. Mariam Cissé, said to be in her 20s and with over 100,000 TikTok followers, posted videos about life in her Tonka hometown in the northern Timbuktu region and often expressed support for the army. Her death has shocked the nation, which has been battling a jihadist insurgency since 2012. State TV said she had simply wanted to promote her community and support the army through her TikTok posts. Mali is grappling with a fuel blockade imposed on the capital by jihadist groups that has severely disrupted daily life, with the African Union expressing \"deep concern\".\n\nMs Cissé was seized by the suspected jihadists while live-streaming from a market in a neighbouring town, French public radio RFI reported. \"My sister was arrested on Thursday by the jihadists,\" her brother told the AFP news agency, saying they had accused her of \"informing the Malian army of their movements\". Over the weekend she was moved to Tonka by motorbike and shot at the town's Independence Square while her brother was in the crowd, AFP reports. A security source told the agency she had been assassinated because she had been accused of filming jihadists \"for the Malian army\". In some of her TikTok videos, she wears military uniform, with one of her posts captioned Vive Mali (Long Live Mali).\n\nHer death comes as the crisis caused by the jihadist blockade has worsened, with schools and universities remaining shut for weeks. The government has suspended learning institutions since last month and said that it would do \"everything possible to address the crisis\" so that they would reopen on Monday. The dire situation has persisted, and on Friday the French foreign ministry advised its citizens to urgently leave the country while commercial flights were available. On Sunday, AU Commission chairperson Mahmoud Ali Youssouf said he was concerned about the \"rapid deterioration of the security situation where terrorist groups have imposed blockades, disrupted access to essential supplies, and severely worsened humanitarian conditions for civilian populations\". He condemned the \"deliberate attacks against innocent civilians\" that had caused \"unacceptable loss of lives and heightened instability\". He added that the AU was ready \"to support Mali, as well as all Sahel countries, during this particularly challenging period\". For weeks, Mali has been hit by fuel shortages, especially in the capital Bamako, after militants from an al-Qaeda affiliate imposed a blockade by attacking tankers on major highways. Mali is landlocked, so all fuel supplies are brought in by road from neighbouring states such as Senegal and Ivory Coast. The military seized power in Mali in 2021 and promised to improve security, but the jihadist insurgency has continued and large parts of the north and east of the country remain outside government control.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nGetty Images/BBC",

    "text": "Nord Stream suspect accuses Italy of pressure to confess\n\n10 hours ago Share Save Sarah Rainsford Southern and Eastern Europe correspondent in Rome Share Save\n\nDanish Defence handout Three of the four pipelines under the Baltic Sea near Bornholm were damaged\n\nA Ukrainian former military officer is on the 10th day of a hunger strike in an Italian prison, where he has accused the authorities of mistreating him to make him confess to blowing up Russia's Nord Stream gas pipelines under the Baltic Sea in 2022. Serhiy Kuznetsov was detained in Italy in August on an arrest warrant from Germany. In a letter shown to the BBC by his lawyer, Mr Kuznetsov says he is being treated as \"criminal no.1\", held in a high-security facility alongside suspected members of so-called Islamic State (IS or Isis). The BBC has contacted the prison, but it has not yet commented. No-one has admitted carrying out the attack on the pipelines carrying Russian gas to Germany.\n\nMr Kuznetsov's lawyer says he feels his client has been abandoned by his country, too\n\nIn his first public comment since his arrest, Mr Kuznetsov writes - by hand - that \"the Italians have been cynically ignoring my dietary habits for the past two months\" - a reference to his vegetarian diet. \"They think that these restrictions can affect my position, and make me confess my guilt. But such efforts are futile.\" A relative of Mr Kuznetsov's told me they had tried to deliver special food to the prison, but had been refused - and they were worried that he seemed \"exhausted\". The Nord Stream pipelines were destroyed deep beneath the Baltic Sea at the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. It was a high profile and controversial attack. Many initially suspected Russian involvement and an attempt by Moscow to blackmail Europe by restricting its energy supplies. But this summer, German prosecutors activated arrest warrants for two of the men they suspect of carrying out the attack: Serhiy Kuznetsov and a second Ukrainian citizen, Volodymyr Zhuravlyov, who was detained in Poland. German prosecutors have cited charges of \"anti-constitutional sabotage\" as a basis for the extradition requests. A judge in Warsaw ruled against Mr Zhuravlyov's extradition, saying that, if Ukrainians were involved, such an attack would count as legitimate self-defence in a \"bloody, genocidal war\". In Italy, by contrast, a court in Bologna last month approved Serhiy Kuznetsov's extradition in a closed hearing. He is currently appealing against that ruling for a second time. \"He told me he had lost 9kg when I said that his clothes were hanging loosely,\" the Ukrainian's lawyer, Nicola Canestrini, said, after visiting his client on hunger strike. The lawyer said Kuznetsov was refusing all solid food but was \"doing fine and is clear of mind\".",

    "text": "A jailed hacking kingpin reveals all about the gang that left a trail of destruction\n\n22 hours ago Share Save Joe Tidy Cyber correspondent, BBC World Service Share Save\n\nBBC Vyacheslav Penchukov, aka \"Tank\", left thousands of victims across the world\n\nAfter years of reading about \"Tank\" and months of planning a visit to him in a Colorado prison, I hear the door click open before I see him walk into the room. I stand up ready to give this former cyber-crime kingpin a professional hello. But, like a cheeky cartoon character, he pokes his head around a pillar with a giant grin on his face and winks. Tank, whose real name is Vyacheslav Penchukov, climbed to the top of the cyber-underworld not so much with technical wizardry, but with criminal charm. \"I am a friendly guy, I make friends easily,\" the 39-year-old Ukrainian says, with a broad smile. Having friends in high places is said to be one of the reasons Penchukov managed to evade police for so long. He spent nearly 10 years on the FBI's Most Wanted list and was a leader of two separate gangs in two distinct periods of cyber-crime history. It is rare to speak to such a high-level cyber-criminal who has left so many victims behind him; Penchukov spoke to us for six hours over two days as part of the ongoing podcast series Cyber Hack: Evil Corp. The exclusive interview - Penchukov's first ever - reveals the inner workings of these prolific cyber-gangs, the mindset of some of the individuals behind them and never-before-known details about hackers still at large - including the alleged leader of the sanctioned Russian group, Evil Corp.\n\nIt took more than 15 years for authorities to finally arrest Penchukov in a dramatic operation in Switzerland in 2022. \"There were snipers on the roof and the police put me on the ground and handcuffed me and put a bag on my head on the street in front of my kids. They were scared,\" he recalls with annoyance. He is still bitter about how he was arrested, arguing that it was over the top. His thousands of victims around the world would strongly disagree with him: Penchukov and the gangs he either led or was a part of stole tens of millions of pounds from them. In the late 2000s, he and the infamous Jabber Zeus crew used revolutionary cyber-crime tech to steal directly from the bank accounts of small businesses, local authorities and even charities. Victims saw their savings wiped out and balance sheets upended. In the UK alone, there were more than 600 victims, who lost more than £4m ($5.2m) in just three months. Between 2018 and 2022, Penchukov set his sights higher, joining the thriving ransomware ecosystem with gangs that targeted international corporations and even a hospital. Englewood Correctional Facility, where Penchukov is being held, would not let us take any recording equipment inside the prison, so a producer and I make notes during the interview as we are watched over by a guard nearby.\n\nCorrespondent Joe Tidy outside Englewood Correctional Facility in Colorado\n\nThe first thing that stands out about Penchukov is that, although he is eager to be released, he seems in high spirits and is clearly making the most of his time in prison. He tells me he plays a lot of sport, is learning French and English - a well-thumbed Russian-English dictionary stays by his side throughout our interview - and is racking up high-school diplomas. He must be smart, I suggest. \"Not smart enough - I'm in prison,\" he jokes. Englewood is a low-security prison with good facilities. The low-rise but sprawling building sits in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado. The dusty grass verges surrounding the prison are teeming with noisy prairie dogs scurrying into their burrows whenever disturbed by prison vehicles coming and going. It is a long way from Donetsk, Ukraine, where he ran his first cyber-crime gang after falling into hacking through games cheat forums, where he would look for cheats for his favourite video games like Fifa 99 and Counterstrike. He became the leader of the prolific Jabber Zeus crew - so named because of their use of the revolutionary Zeus malware and their favourite communication platform, Jabber. Penchukov worked with a small group of hackers that included Maksim Yakubets - a Russian who would go on to be sanctioned by the US government, accused of leading the infamous cyber-group Evil Corp. Penchukov says that throughout the late 2000s, the Jabber Zeus crew would work out of an office in the centre of Donetsk, putting in six to seven-hour days stealing money from victims overseas. Penchukov would often end his day with a DJ set in the city, playing under the name DJ Slava Rich. Cyber-crime in those days was \"easy money\", he says. The banks had no idea how to stop it and police in the US, Ukraine and the UK could not keep up.\n\nAfter hacking by day, Penchukov performed as DJ Slava Rich by night\n\nIn his early 20s, he was making so much money he bought himself \"new cars like they were new clothes\". He had six in total - \"all expensive German ones\". But police got a breakthrough when they managed to eavesdrop on the criminals' text chats in Jabber and discovered the true identity of Tank using details he had given away about the birth of his daughter. The net closed in on the Jabber Zeus crew, and an FBI-led operation called Trident Breach saw arrests in Ukraine and the UK. But Penchukov slipped through the net thanks to a tip-off from someone he will not name. And thanks to one of his fast cars. \"I had an Audi S8 with a 500-horsepower Lamborghini engine so when I saw the cops flashing lights in my rear view mirror, I jumped the red light and lost them easily. It gave me a chance to test the full power of my car,\" he says. He laid low with a friend for a while, but when the FBI left Ukraine, the local authorities seemed to lose interest in him. So Penchukov kept under the radar and, he says, went straight. He started a company buying and selling coal, but the FBI was still on the trail. \"I was on holiday in Crimea when I got a message from a friend who saw that I had been put on the FBI Most Wanted list. I thought I had got away with it all - then I realised I have a new problem,\" he says, an obvious understatement.\n\nFBI Penchukov (R) was among the FBI's most wanted; his two co-conspirators have yet to be caught\n\nHis lawyer at the time was calm, though, and advised him not to worry: as long as he did not travel outside of Ukraine or Russia, US police could not do much. The Ukrainian authorities did eventually come knocking - but not to arrest him. Penchukov had been outed as a wealthy hacker wanted by the West and he alleges that almost every day, officials would come and shake him down for money. His coal-selling business was going well until Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014. President Putin's so-called \"Little Green Men\" - Russian soldiers in unmarked uniforms - ruined his business and missiles struck his apartment in Donetsk, damaging his daughter's bedroom. Penchukov says that it was business troubles and the constant payouts to Ukrainian officials that led him to once again fire up his laptop and get back into the cyber-crime life. \"I just decided it was the fastest way to make money to pay them,\" he says. His journey charts the evolution of modern cyber-crime - from quick and easy bank account theft to ransomware, today's most pernicious and damaging type of cyber-attack used in high-profile hacks this year, including on UK High Street stalwart Marks & Spencer. He says ransomware was harder work but the money was good. \"Cyber-security had improved a lot, but we were able to make about $200,000 a month. Much higher profits.\" In a revealing anecdote, he remembers rumours that started about a crew being paid $20m (£15.3m) from a hospital that had been crippled by ransomware. Penchukov says the news fired up the hundreds of hackers in the criminal forums who all then went after US medical institutions to repeat the pay day. These hacker communities have a \"herd mentality\", he says: \"People don't care about the medical side of things - all they see is 20 millions being paid.\"\n\nPenchukov's gang left many victims; one said they felt \"disbelief and horror\" at losing their money\n\nPenchukov rebuilt his connections and skills to become one of the top affiliates of ransomware services, including Maze, Egregor and the prolific group Conti. When asked if these criminal groups worked with Russian security services - a regular accusation from the West - Penchukov shrugs and says: \"Of course.\" He says that some ransomware gang members sometimes talked about speaking to \"their handlers\" in the Russian security services, like the FSB. The BBC wrote to the Russian Embassy in London, asking if the Russian government or its intelligence agencies engaged with cyber criminals to aid cyber espionage, but received no reply. Penchukov soon rose to the top again and became a leader of IcedID - a gang that infected more than 150,000 computers with malicious software and led to various types of cyber-attack, including ransomware. Penchukov was in charge of a team of hackers who would sift through the infected computers to work out how best to make money from them. One victim they infected with ransomware in 2020 was the University of Vermont Medical Center in the US. According to US prosecutors, this led to the loss of more than $30m (£23m) and left the medical centre unable to provide many critical patient services for more than two weeks. Although no-one died, prosecutors say the attack, which disabled 5,000 hospital computers, created a risk of death or serious injury to patients. Penchukov denies he actually did it, claiming he only admitted to it in order to reduce his sentence. Overall, Penchukov, who has since changed his surname to Andreev, feels the two nine-year sentences he is serving concurrently are too much for what he did (he is hoping to get out much sooner). He has also been ordered to pay $54m (£41.4m) in restitution to victims.\n\nHis view as a young hacker who started in cyber-crime as a teenager is that Western companies and people could afford to lose money and that everything was covered by insurance anyway. But when I speak to one of his early victims from the Jabber Zeus days, it is clear his attacks did have a harmful impact on innocent people. Lieber's Luggage, a family-run business in Albuquerque, New Mexico, had $12,000 (£9,200) stolen in one swipe by the gang. Owner Leslee still recalls the shock years later. \"It was just disbelief and horror when the bank called because we had no idea what had happened, and the bank clearly didn't have any idea,\" she says. While a modest sum, it was devastating for the business, as the money was used for paying rent, buying merchandise and paying staff. They did not have any savings to fall back on and, to make matters worse, Leslee's elderly mother was in charge of the company accounts and she blamed herself until the theft was uncovered. \"We had all of those feelings, the anger, the frustration, the fear,\" she says. When I ask them what they would like to say to the hackers responsible, they think it is futile to try to change the minds of these callous criminals. \"There's nothing that we could say that would affect him,\" Leslee says. \"I wouldn't give him the time of day,\" her husband Frank adds. Penchukov says he did not think about the victims, and he does not seem to do so much now, either. The only sign of remorse in our conversation was when he talked about a ransomware attack on a disabled children's charity. His only real regret seems to be that he became too trusting with his fellow hackers, which ultimately led to him and many other criminals being caught. \"You can't make friends in cyber-crime, because the next day, your friends will be arrested and they will become an informant,\" he says. \"Paranoia is a constant friend of hackers,\" he says. But success leads to mistakes. \"If you do cyber-crime long enough you lose your edge,\" he says, wistfully.\n\nFBI Yakubets - known as 'Aqua' - was added to the FBI's Most Wanted list in 2019",

    "text": "Iran faces unprecedented drought as water crisis hits Tehran\n\n19 hours ago Share Save Parham Ghobadi BBC Persian Share Save\n\nEPA\n\nIran - especially its capital, Tehran - is facing an unprecedented drought this autumn, with rainfall at record lows and reservoirs nearly empty. Officials are pleading with citizens to conserve water as the crisis deepens. President Masoud Pezeshkian has warned that if there is not enough rainfall soon, Tehran's water supply could be rationed. But he said that even rationing might not be enough to prevent a disaster. \"If rationing doesn't work,\" Pezeshkian said, \"we may have to evacuate Tehran.\" His comments have prompted criticism in Iranian newspapers and on social media. Former Tehran mayor Gholamhossein Karbaschi called the idea \"a joke\" and said \"evacuating Tehran makes no sense at all\".\n\nIran's meteorological officials say no rainfall is expected over the next 10 days. Meanwhile, the water crisis is already affecting daily life in the capital. \"I'm planning to buy water tankers to use for toilets and other necessities,\" a woman in Tehran told BBC Persian. In the summer, Iranian rapper Vafa Ahmadpoor posted a video on social media showing a kitchen tap with no running water. \"It's been four or five hours,\" he said. \"I've bought bottled water just to be able to go to the toilet.\"\n\nDams nearly empty\n\nThe manager of the Latian Dam, one of Tehran's main water sources, says it now holds less than 10% of its capacity. The nearby Karaj Dam — which supplies water to both Tehran and Alborz provinces — is in a similarly dire condition. \"I have never seen this dam so empty since I was born,\" an elderly local resident told Iranian state TV. According to Mohammad-Ali Moallem, the manager of the Karaj Dam, rainfall has plummeted dramatically. \"We had a 92% decrease in rain compared to last year,\" he said. \"We have only eight per cent water in our reservoir — and most of it is unusable and considered 'dead water.'\"\n\nFears of water cuts\n\nThe government is now pinning its hopes on late autumn rain, but forecasts are bleak. Iran's Minister of Energy, Abbas Ali Abadi, has warned the situation could soon force authorities to cut water supplies. \"Some nights we might decrease the water flow to zero,\" he said. Officials have also announced plans to penalise households and businesses that consume excessive amounts of water.\n\nABEDIN TAHERKENREH/EPA/Shutterstock The government has warned that it may have to restrict water supplies if the weather remains dry\n\nPipes, war damage - and a widening crisis\n\nIran's energy minister Ali Abadi has said Tehran's water crisis is not only due to a lack of rainfall. He blamed water leakage caused by the capital's century-old water infrastructure and even pointed to the recent 12-day war with Israel. During that conflict, Israel targeted the northern Tehran neighbourhood of Tajrish on 15 June. Afterwards videos showed heavy flooding in the area. The day after the strike, the Israel Defence Forces said it had targeted Iranian military \"command centres\". But the crisis extends far beyond the capital. The head of Iran's National Centre for Climate and Drought Crisis Management, Ahmad Vazifeh, has warned that, apart from Tehran, dams in many other provinces — including West Azerbaijan, East Azerbaijan and Markazi — are also in a \"worrying state\", with water levels in the single-digit percentages. In Mashhad, Iran's second-largest city, officials are sounding the alarm as well. The Governor of Khorasan Razavi Province in north-east Iran, said the water reserves in Mashhad's dams have dropped to \"less than eight percent,\" warning that the province faces a \"mega-challenge of drought.\" CEO of Mashhad's Water and Wastewater Company put the figure even lower. \"The storage level of the city's main dam is below three percent,\" Hossein Esmaeilian said. \"Only three percent of the combined capacity of Mashhad's four water-supplying dams — Torogh, Kardeh, Doosti, and Ardak — remains. Apart from Doosti Dam, the other three are out of operation.\"\n\nA crisis long foreseen",

The Israeli military said Lt Goldin, who was 23 when he died, was formally identified and will now be buried. He left behind parents, a sister, two brothers, and a fiancée. Hamas's armed wing had said on Sunday that it would hand over Lt Goldin's body as part of a ceasefire deal. Hamas has now returned all 20 living hostages, and 24 out of 28 deceased hostages under the first phase of the deal.\n\nOn Sunday, Lt Goldin's father Simcha Goldin said in a statement: \"Victory means bringing home the hostages and bringing home our soldiers to Israel.\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Isaac Herzog both said they had kept a picture of Lt Goldin in their offices for the past 11 years. Netanyahu said \"we didn't give up\" on bringing him home. \"I know the agony that his family's been through, I know the longing for his return that united the people of Israel and today we're united in bringing him finally to his parents, to his family, to a grave in Israel.\" Efforts to retrieve Lt Goldin \"involved extensive intelligence efforts, alongside operational activities on the ground\" over the past decade and during the last two years of war between Israel and Hamas, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said. The military expressed \"deep condolences to the family and continues to make every effort to return all the deceased hostages and is prepared for the continued implementation of the agreement\". Herzog said the government would \"continue to act tirelessly\" to bring home all the hostages. Of the four hostages who remain in Gaza, three are Israeli and one is Thai.\n\nReuters\n\nLt Goldin, from Kfar Saba, is the only deceased hostage whose remains were being held in Gaza before the Hamas-led 7 October 2023 attack on Israel, which sparked the latest war. He was killed in combat on 1 August 2014, not long after the start of a ceasefire in that year's war between Israel and Hamas. He was among a group of Israeli soldiers patrolling an agricultural area near Rafah in southern Gaza when they were attacked by a group of Hamas fighters. The Israeli military determined that Lt Goldin was killed along with two other soldiers in a firefight, and that his body was then dragged into an underground tunnel by the Hamas fighters. The Israeli military unleashed massive firepower to try to prevent Hamas from taking Lt Goldin hostage. Scores of Palestinian civilians were killed in the bombardment of Rafah, which continued for four days, including after Lt Goldin was declared dead.",

    "text": "Jacob Zuma's daughter denies terrorism charges as her trial starts\n\n16 hours ago Share Save Khanyisile Ngcobo and Nomsa Maseko, BBC Africa, Johannesburg Share Save\n\nGallo Images via Getty Images Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla has said the state's case against her is weak\n\nThe daughter of former South African President Jacob Zuma has pleaded not guilty to terrorism-related charges at the start of her trial in the port city of Durban. Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla is being prosecuted over comments she made on social media four years ago during deadly protests in South Africa following the arrest of her father. A week of anarchy in several parts of the country in July 2021, including looting and arson, left at least 300 people dead and caused damage worth an estimated $2.8bn (£2.2bn). Zuma-Sambudla, 43, has been accused of fuelling this unrest and faces charges of incitement to commit terrorism and public violence.\n\nThe protests were concentrated in the provinces of Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal and followed the former president's arrest for disobeying a court order to testify at an inquiry into allegations of corruption while he was in power. Ms Zuma-Sambudla has always denied the charges against her, with her lawyer previously labelling the state's case as weak. She has also repeatedly said the charges against her were an attempt to settle political scores with her father after he started his own political party and campaigned against the African National Congress (ANC). This was echoed by the Jacob Zuma foundation, which said the case was an \"abuse of power\" and a \"systematic campaign of political and familial harassment\" against the former president and his family. A handful of supporters from her party, uMkhonto weSizwe, turned up outside the KwaZulu-Natal high court, while her father and other party leaders attended the hearings inside.\n\nGetty Images/BBC",

    "text": "UK to help protect Belgium after suspected Russian drone incursions\n\n2 days ago Share Save Amy Walker Share Save\n\nSir Richard Knighton: \"We don't yet know... the source of those drones\"\n\nBritain is providing military support to Belgium after a series of suspected Russian drone incursions into its airspace, the new chief of the defence staff has said. Sir Richard Knighton told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg that his Belgian counterpart had asked for assistance earlier this week and that equipment and personnel were now on the way. Brussels Airport was forced to close temporarily on Thursday night after drones were spotted nearby. They were also seen in other locations, including a military base. It follows a series of drone incursion over several Nato nations that disrupted air travel. Russia has denied accusations of conducting \"hybrid warfare\" on allies of Ukraine.\n\nSir Richard said it was not known for sure if the incursions were by Russia, but that it was \"plausible\" they had been ordered by Moscow. Defence Secretary John Healey said in a statement: \"As hybrid threats grow, our strength lies in our alliances and our collective resolve to defend, deter and protect our critical infrastructure and airspace\". Members of the RAF's 2 Force Protection Wing are likely to be deployed, the BBC understands. Alongside Nato allies, Sir Richard added that the UK would help Belgium \"by providing our kit and capability\". The German defence ministry said on Friday that it too would support Belgium with anti-drone measures after a request from Brussels. About 3,000 Brussels Airlines passengers were affected by Thursday's disruption, with the carrier saying it faced \"considerable costs\" from cancelling or diverting dozens of flights. German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius and the Belgian security services have said they suspect Russia of being behind the incursion, but Belgian Defence Minister Theo Francken previously indicated there was no evidence to suggest this. \"At first, drones flying over our military bases were seen as our problem,\" Francken said earlier this week. \"Now it has become a serious threat affecting civilian infrastructure across multiple European countries.\"\n\nInstagram/Royal Air Force Regiment The RAF's 2 Force Protection Wing was deployed in an anti-drone role to the Paris Olympics in 2024\n\nSir Richard said Russia was, broadly speaking, \"the most pressing threat right now\" to Europe. \"The illegal invasion of Ukraine has shown the barbaric nature of Russia's war efforts.\" He added that sabotage and killings had been carried out by Russia on UK soil, and that so-called hybrid warfare was an area in which \"we [the UK] need to strengthen ourselves\". Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and currently controls around a fifth of its territory, including the Crimean peninsula that it annexed in 2014. Hybrid threats use a mix of military and non-military tactics and are designed to interfere with infrastructure or institutions, according to Nato.",

    "text": "Mystery 'fedora man' at Louvre heist scene revealed as teenage detective fan\n\nWatch: 15-year-old Pedro is the well-dressed mystery man behind the viral image\n\nThe dandy, it turns out, is a local teenage fan of Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot who just happened to be at a real crime scene.\n\nHowever, the fedora man remained an enigma - until now.\n\nPolice moved swiftly to arrest and charge four people for the crime, while the Louvre director admitted CCTV security was inadequate.\n\nThe dapper youth in a hat was photographed outside the museum that Sunday and went viral on social media, prompting theories about his identity.\n\nIn the three weeks since the Louvre museum heist, as investigators sought to find out who was behind it and why the French crown jewels had been so easy to steal, another mystery remained: who the \"fedora man\" was.\n\nPedro Elias Garzon Delvaux, a 15-year-old from Rambouillet, south-west of Paris told the Associated Press (AP) news agency that he had planned to visit the Louvre with his family but found the museum was closed.\n\n\"We didn't know there was a heist,\" he said.\n\nAs he asked officers about the closure, an AP photographer seeking to capture the security cordon took a picture and included Pedro in the frame.\n\nPedro only realised the photo had gone viral four days later, when a friend sent him a screenshot asking: \"Is that you?\"\n\nWhen he replied that it was, the friend said he had five million views on TikTok. \"I was a bit surprised,\" Pedro told the AP.\n\nHe was even more shocked when his mother called to say the picture had appeared in The New York Times. It made a big impact on him, he said, because he reads that newspaper and \"it's not every day you're in the New York Times\".\n\n\"People said, 'You've become a star'. I was astonished that just with one photo you can become viral in a few days.\"\n\nAsked why he wore an old-fashioned waistcoat and a fedora to the museum, Pedro said he began dressing this way recently, inspired by 20th-century statesmen and fictional detectives.\n\n\"I like to be chic,\" he told the AP. \"I go to school like this.\"\n\nAs wild speculation about the photo of him circulated online - some wondered whether he might be a real detective or an AI fake - Pedro remained silent for weeks.\n\n\"I didn't want to say immediately it was me,\" he said. \"With this photo there is a mystery, so you have to make it last.\"",

    "text": "Protesters force delay to opening of Nigeria's new art museum\n\n11 hours ago Share Save Todah Opeyemi BBC Africa, Lagos Share Save\n\nX The protesters insulted the visitors who had gone for a preview event\n\nProtesters have targeted a new multi-million dollar museum in Nigeria and forced organisers to postpone Tuesday's planned opening. Videos showed a group insulting foreign guests and ordering them to leave after entering the grounds of the Museum of West African Art (Mowaa) in Benin City on Sunday. They were angry that the museum was not called the Benin Royal Museum and was not under the control of the Oba, the area's traditional king. With preservation and restoration facilities, Mowaa was in part conceived as a home for the Benin Bronzes - artefacts looted from there by British soldiers in the 19th Century. But a dispute over ownership has meant they are not at the museum.\n\nFollowing the storming of the museum, a spokesperson for the institution told the BBC they had never made any claims to the Benin Bronzes and are \"focused primarily on modern and contemporary art with a historical collections\" display from Nigeria and elsewhere in West Africa. All guests were safely escorted to secure locations, according to a statement from the museum. \"We sincerely apologise for any inconvenience this situation may have caused,\" Mowaa said. No new date for the museum's opening has been announced. A resident of Edo state told the BBC the frustration stems from what many see as a hijacking of a local project. \"The Benin Oba, traditional rulers and the government of Edo are not happy about it,\" the resident added.\n\nMuseum of West African Art (MOWAA), Marco Cappelletti/Marco Cappelletti Studio Mowaa, designed by British-Ghanian architect David Adjaye, cost an estimated $25m (£19m) to build\n\n\"Edo\" was initially in the museum's name, but this was later dropped. Executive director Phillip Ihenacho told the BBC the backers wanted the institution to serve a wider purpose beyond Nigeria. In its statement, Mowaa said the protest \"appeared to stem from disputes between the previous and current state administrations\". The museum emphasised it was an independent, non-profit organisation and, though a former state governor had backed the project, he had no interest in it \"financial or otherwise\". Mowaa has now cancelled all preview events and advised visitors to avoid the campus until the situation is resolved. \"We are deeply grateful to all our guests - many of whom travelled long distances to be here - for their understanding, patience and resilience,\" the statement said. \"We sincerely apologise for any inconvenience this situation may have caused.\"\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nGetty Images/BBC",

Three of those were seriously injured and taken to hospital.\n\nA local waiter, who gave his name only as Pedro, told the Reuters news agency that he jumped into the water in an attempt to save people being swept out.\n\n\"As soon as I saw a man waving at me I took my clothes off, jumped to the water and I managed to grab three of them and save them. I couldn't save the woman because she passed away at that moment,\" he said.\n\nEyewitness Carlos said he warned people taking photos to move away from the waves but \"they did not pay attention\".\n\nOfficials say the Canary Islands, the Spanish archipelago Tenerife belongs to, are on alert for coastal hazards.\n\nThey warned sea conditions are expected to worsen with swells reaching two-to-four metres, and tourists and locals should exercise \"extreme caution\".",

Malaysian Coast Guard estimate about 70 people were on board when the vessel sank near the resort island of Langkawi.\n\nAt least seven people have died after a boat carrying undocumented migrants sank near the border between Thailand and Malaysia.\n\nMalaysia's maritime authority expects the operation, involving sea surface and aerial searches, to last seven days.\n\nThe body found in the water on Sunday was that of a Rohingya woman, Malaysia's state-owned news agency Bernama reported.\n\nOf the 13 rescued, 11 are Rohingyas and two are Bangladeshis.\n\nThe Rohingyas, who are primarily Muslim, are one of the many ethnic minorities in the predominantly Buddhist country, but they are denied citizenship by the government of Myanmar.\n\nSince August 2017, a deadly crackdown by Myanmar's army sent hundreds of thousands of Rohingyas fleeing across the border into Bangladesh.\n\nConflict and poor living conditions in Bangladesh however have also prompted some Rohingyas to make precarious journeys on overcrowded vessels to Malaysia, a Muslim country which some envision to be a safe haven in the region.\n\nOfficials say many of them would have each paid more than $3,000 (£2,300) for these passages by sea.\n\nThese boats are often small and cramped, lacking in basic facilities like fresh water and sanitation.\n\nAnd they do not always make it to Malaysia. Some die while being stranded at sea, while others are sometimes detained or deported.",

    "text": "Uganda president admits Kenyan activists were arrested and held in 'the fridge'\n\n2 days ago Share Save Tiffany Wertheimer and Damian Zane Share Save\n\nEPA Nicholas Oyoo (L) and Bob Njagi (R) were greeted by supporters when they arrived back in Kenya's capital, Nairobi, on Saturday\n\nUgandan President Yoweri Museveni has for the first time acknowledged that two Kenyan activists who were missing in his country for five weeks had been arrested. Last month, eyewitnesses reported seeing Bob Njagi and Nicholas Oyoo being forced into a car by masked uniformed men after a political event where they were supporting Ugandan opposition leader Bobi Wine. News of their release was confirmed on Saturday but up to that point the authorities had denied that they were being detained. In a live interview on Saturday evening, Museveni described the two men as \"experts in riots\" who had then been put \"in the fridge for some days\".\n\nThe president, who has been in power for almost four decades and is running for another term in office, was responding to a question about the recent deadly youth-led protests in neighbouring Tanzania. Museveni blamed foreign groups for stoking up trouble and said \"the ones who are doing that game here in Uganda will end up badly\". Without naming them, he added that the two Kenyan activists were released after he received calls from \"some Kenyan leaders\" who said they should be handed back. Mr Njagi and Mr Oyoo were welcomed by supporters at the main airport in Kenya's capital, Nairobi, on Saturday. \"Thirty-eight days of abduction was not easy. We didn't think that we were going to come out alive because we were being abducted by the military,\" Mr Njagi said. Kenya's Foreign Minister Musalia Mudavadi said their release followed \"sustained diplomatic engagement between Kenya and Uganda\". Activist organisation Vocal Africa, who had been campaigning for the two men to be freed said: \"Let this moment signal an important shift towards upholding the human rights of East Africans anywhere in East African Community\".\n\nIn a joint statement, Vocal Africa, the Law Society of Kenya and Amnesty International thanked the Kenyan and Ugandan governments, as well as \"all active citizens\" who had campaigned for the release. Former pop star Bobi Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, is running against Museveni for the presidency in next year's elections. Bobi Wine accused the Ugandan government of targeting the two Kenyans for associating with him. \"If they committed any offence, why were they not produced before court and formally charged?\" he asked in a post on X on Sunday. Ugandan security agencies have often been accused of orchestrating the detention of opposition politicians and supporters while not in uniform. Some of those arrested have later resurfaced in court facing criminal charges.\n\nThe latest disappearances mirror past incidents involving politicians and activists across the East African region. Last year, Njagi was picked up in Kenya by masked men during a wave of abductions believed to have been targeting government critics in the country. He surfaced a month later, after a court ordered police to produce him. He later recounted the harrowing conditions in captivity, where he said he was often isolated and denied food. Earlier this year, Kenyan activist Boniface Mwangi and his Ugandan counterpart Agather Atuhaire were detained in Tanzania and held incommunicado for days before being abandoned at their respective national borders. They later recounted being brutally mistreated, including sexual torture at the hands of the Tanzanian authorities – allegations which police dismissed as \"hearsay\". Last year, another Uganda opposition figure, Kizza Besigye, mysteriously disappeared in Nairobi only to surface four days later in a military court in Uganda, where he faces treason charges. The cases have since sparked widespread condemnation and concerns that East African governments could be collaborating to contain dissent.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nGetty Images/BBC",

    "text": "Cryptoqueen who fled China for London mansion to be sentenced over £5bn Bitcoin stash\n\n3 hours ago Share Save Tony Han Global China Unit Share Save\n\nMetropolitan Police Qian Zhemin enjoyed a lavish lifestyle of travel and shopping before UK police discovered her stash of crypto\n\nA woman, said by police to have bought cryptocurrency now worth billions of pounds using funds stolen from thousands of Chinese pensioners, is due to be sentenced this week for money laundering. After fleeing China, she moved to a mansion in Hampstead, north London. The Metropolitan Police raided it a year later and made one of the world's single largest crypto seizures. More than 100,000 Chinese people invested their money in her company - which claimed to be developing high-tech health products and mining cryptocurrency. In reality, she embezzled the funds, police say. As she awaits sentencing, investors have told the BBC World Service they hope to get at least some of their cash back from the UK authorities. Anything left unclaimed would normally default to the UK government - leading some to speculate that the Treasury could stand to gain from the haul. \"If we can gather all the evidence together, we hope the UK government, the Crown Prosecution Service and the High Court can show compassion,\" said one victim we are calling Mr Yu, who says his marriage failed as a result of the fraud. \"Because now, it's only that haul of Bitcoin [cryptocurrency] that can return us a little bit of what we lost.\" Qian Zhimin, 47, arrived in the UK under a fake passport in September 2017, after Chinese police started investigating her. She moved into a mansion on the edge of Hampstead Heath, at a rent of more than £17,000 ($22,700) a month. To pay for this, she needed to convert her Bitcoin stash back into money she could spend. So she posed as a wealthy antiques and diamond heiress, and hired a former takeaway worker as her personal assistant, who she asked to trade the cryptocurrency into other assets, such as cash and property.\n\nMetropolitan Police On fleeing China, Qian rented this house in Hampstead\n\nAs Bitcoin rocketed in value, Qian could achieve what her company promised its investors - that they could \"get rich while lying down\". Her assistant Wen Jian - at her own trial last year, which culminated in a six-year jail term for money laundering - said Qian had spent most of her days lying in bed, gaming and online shopping. But Qian was also drawing up a bold six-year plan for future schemes, according to her diary. Her notes outline plans to found an international bank, buy a Swedish castle, and even to ingratiate herself with a British duke. Her grander stated objective was to become queen of Liberland, an unrecognised microstate on the Croatian-Serbian border, by 2022. In the meantime, Qian had Wen look for houses she could buy in London. But her attempts to purchase an especially large property in Totteridge Common - an area known for its substantial, secluded residences - triggered a police investigation when Wen was unable to account for her boss's wealth.\n\nAttempts by Qian to buy this property in Totteridge sparked a police investigation\n\nPolice raided Qian's Hampstead rental property and uncovered hard drives and laptops found to be loaded with tens of thousands of Bitcoin - believed to be the single largest cryptocurrency seizure in UK history. Qian had set up the company through which money was embezzled just four years earlier, in her native China. Lantian Gerui, or Bluesky Greet in English, claimed to use investors' money to mine - or generate - new Bitcoin, and to invest in a range of pioneering technological devices. But UK police believe this was an elaborate scam, and that Qian's company was simply using promises of high profits to pull more and more investors into the scheme. \"The more information we got about her involvement… that she was actually the leader of the fraud, not just a lower down member… it became obvious that yes she's very clever, she's very switched on, very manipulative, able to persuade a lot of people,\" Det Con Joe Ryan from the Met told the BBC. One of her investors, Mr Yu, says he never suspected anything was wrong because the company drip-fed him a portion of his apparent earnings - just over 100 yuan ($14, £10) - every day. \"That made everyone feel really good, it even gave us the confidence to borrow a little more to invest in the company,\" he says. He and his wife had initially invested 60,000 yuan ($8,429, £6,295) each. They were told, he says, they would make a 200% profit over two and a half years. They were soon taking out thousands of pounds' worth of loans at interest rates of up to 8%, in order to invest more. In addition, Mr Yu reinvested his daily payouts back into the company as soon as he received them. \"There was no rule that you had to reinvest your earnings, but I suppose we were just too weak to resist. They just pumped up our dreams… until we lost all self-control, all critical judgment.\"\n\nChinese social media Qian Zhimin's company staged huge meetings and banquets for current and prospective investors in China\n\nInvestors saw their daily payouts topped up for each new person they signed up. This helped the scam reach some 120,000 people, based in every one of China's provinces, according to documents from trials in China of the company's official promoters. Their deposits totalled more than 40bn yuan ($5.6bn, £4.2bn), the UK's Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has found. A former company employee later testified that it was new investors' money that had been funding the daily payouts, not crypto-mining dividends. Lantian Gerui's marketing exploited the loneliness of many middle-aged and elderly Chinese. Qian wrote poems about social responsibility, with lines such as: \"We must love the elderly with the infatuation of a first romance.\" The company also organised mass holidays and banquets for current and potential investors. These were used to promote yet more investment opportunities - slideshows and card machines at the ready. Lantian Gerui also trumpeted its love of China as a nation, another ploy calculated to appeal to the elderly. \"Our patriotism was our Achilles' heel, that's what they exploited,\" says Mr Yu, who is in his 60s. \"They said that they wanted to make China number one in the world.\" A range of speakers endorsed the company, including the son-in-law of the late Chairman Mao, the founding father of the People's Republic of China - Mr Yu said. \"We in our generation all looked up to Chairman Mao, so if even his son-in-law was vouching for it, how could we not trust it?\"\n\nThe company even held an event in the Great Hall of the People, where China's legislature meets, according to an investor who attended the event and two others we spoke to. \"That bunch of [promoters], they'd take something red and persuade you it was white, take something black and convince you it was red,\" Mr Yu says. Despite leading this high-profile enterprise, Qian was notoriously secretive, known only as Huahua or Little Flower to her clients, and communicating with them largely through the poems she posted on her blog. But she would emerge for the biggest investors - those who put in at least 6m yuan ($842,000, £628,000) - inviting them to more intimate events, according to one of these clients, Mr Li. \"Those of us present, you could say that we were starstruck,\" he remembers. \"We all saw her as our Goddess of Wealth. \"She started encouraging us to dream big… that within three years, she'd give us enough wealth to last our families three generations.\" Mr Li, his wife, and his brother, invested some 10m yuan ($1.3m, £1m) between them.\n\nAlamy Qian was aiming to become queen of Liberland - 7 sq km of uninhabited marshland on a western bank of the River Danube\n\nA Chinese police investigation into Lantian Gerui, launched in mid-2017, signalled the beginning of the end for Qian's scheme. \"The payouts suddenly stopped,\" Mr Yu recalls. \"The company said the police were doing some checks… though we were promised that payments would resume soon enough.\" What helped the investors initially keep calm, he says, was company managers' reassurance that this was just a temporary blip, urging them not to approach the police. What he later discovered through the Chinese court cases, he says, is that Qian had paid off those senior managers to assuage investors' concerns - while she fled to the UK with the money. Qian was not entirely oblivious to the plight of her investors - she outlined a plan in her diary to pay back her debts in China, once the price of Bitcoin had reached £50,000 per coin. But her diary makes clear that her priority was to rule and develop Liberland, earmarking millions of pounds for this project. When she was finally arrested in York, in the north of England, last April, police also found four other people at the house, Southwark Crown Court heard at the start of her sentencing hearing on Monday. All four had been brought to the UK specifically to work for Qian in roles such as shopping, cleaning and security - and were employed illegally, the court was told. At the time of her arrest, Qian denied all charges, claiming she was simply fleeing a Chinese government crackdown on crypto entrepreneurs, and disputing evidence presented by the Chinese police. But then, at her trial in September, she unexpectedly pleaded guilty to illegally acquiring and possessing the cryptocurrency.\n\nWatch the moment police raided a house in York to arrest Qian",

    "text": "Battle over Chinese chip maker rocks global car industry\n\n4 hours ago Share Save Suranjana Tewari Asia Business Correspondent Share Save\n\nReuters\n\nIn late September, the Dutch government invoked a Cold War-era emergency law to take control of a Chinese-owned chip company that has operations in the country. The extraordinary move set off a chain of events that sent shock waves through the global motor industry – already battered by US tariffs and China's curbs on rare earth exports. In a statement to the Netherlands parliament, the minister of economic affairs cited \"serious governance shortcomings and actions within Nexperia\" that \"posed a threat\". \"This measure is highly exceptional and intended solely to ensure that the continuity of supply and safeguarding of critical technologies for the Dutch and European economy are not put at risk,\" the statement said. Beijing reacted furiously, accusing the Netherlands of political interference. It imposed export controls and halted deliveries of Nexperia chips from its Chinese facilities to Europe, while the Dutch government froze shipments of key supplies needed to make the chips in China. The disruption caused to the motor industry highlighted a major weakness in the global supply chain of chips vital to car production and opened yet another front in the rivalry between the US and China. The Chinese government has now granted exemptions to export controls on the chips for civilian applications but has not clarified what it considers those to be. But Chinese authorities still want the Dutch to revoke the takeover of Nexperia. \"China welcomes the EU to continue exerting its influence to urge the Netherlands to correct its erroneous practices as soon as possible,\" the commerce ministry said in a statement on Sunday. Nexperia's parent company Wingtech Technology did not respond to a BBC request for comment.\n\nWeaponising supply chains\n\nAt the centre of the dispute is a critical part of the world's chip ecosystem. Nexperia makes so called \"legacy\" or \"building block\" semiconductors that are vital for everything from power-steering and airbags to central locking systems. These are not cutting-edge chips, but they are still indispensable. Some vehicles contain hundreds of them, and Nexperia supplies chips to major carmakers around the world. Around 70%-80% of its output is sent to China for processing, testing and packaging – a dependence that has left car makers exposed to Beijing's control over supply chains. \"Car markers blindsided by the Nexperia mess should be hiring new supply chain management executives, as they clearly learned nothing from Covid... and excessive reliance on [Chinese] supply chains,\" China watcher Bill Bishop wrote in his Sinocism newsletter. It underscores China's ability to choke off global supply chains - just as it did with rare earth exports. Similar to critical minerals, China can hold the West hostage with control of a company as inconspicuously important as Nexperia, according to Bill Echikson, Senior Fellow for the Tech Policy Program at Center for European Policy Analysis. This is as much about digital sovereignty as it is about semiconductors, he adds. Beijing faces a dilemma though. It has been pitching itself as a reliable partner in the face of Trump's tariff chaos, but cutting off supplies of critical products risks undermining that message. \"The narrative was [that, since] Trump came in and caused chaos for everybody, maybe there's an opportunity for China and the EU to work more closely together,\" said Tom Nunlist, Associate Director at Trivium China. That didn't go so well, he adds, with the rare earths shortage showing how trapped Europe and other trading partners are between the US and China, and their ability to upend global trade, according to Mr Nunlist.\n\nNational security\n\nAlong with the takeover, a Dutch court also suspended Nexperia's former chief executive Zhang Xuezhen - who founded its Chinese owner Wingtech - citing mismanagement. Wingtech's shares trade on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and it is partially owned by the Chinese government. It was placed on an official US watch list in 2024, and the so-called entity list was expanded this September to include any firm that is at least 50% owned by companies already on the list. According to court papers released by the Dutch authorities last month in relation to the government's takeover of Nexperia, US authorities had raised concerns about the boss of the chip company before it was taken over. The documents contained evidence that Dutch authorities had told Nexperia it may be able to secure an exemption from the US list if there was a change in leadership because the \"Chinese owner is problematic\". \"It is almost certain that the CEO will have to be replaced to qualify for the exemption from the entity list,\" authorities told Nexperia, according to the documents.\n\nReuters Nexperia makes what are known as legacy chips in Europe and Asia\n\nThe Hague denies the takeover of Nexperia was a response to pressure from any foreign country but said there was evidence to suggest the company's chief executive was transferring its production capacity, financial resources and intellectual property to China. Wingtech did not respond to a request for comment on this. \"I think Nexperia just underlines what is already true, and makes it truer,\" said Mr Nunlist from Trivium China. \"Western countries don't want Chinese investors in these types of strategic manufacturing assets, even legacy chips.\"\n\nCar makers on edge\n\nExperts say the incident is an example of the very real impact of undoing business and economic ties between the West and China. \"This is what decoupling actually looks like at the corporate level, and it's a huge mess,\" said Mr Nunlist. European vehicle industry suppliers have sought clarity on the exemptions that will be applied, and have said it creates extra bureaucracy at an already uncertain time.\n\nGetty Images In an extraordinary move, the Dutch government seized control of Nexperia\n\nIt is possible to switch suppliers, say experts, as rivals chip makers like Infineon, NXP and Texas make similar chips. But supply chains are not precisely planned, they evolve organically and these components are often tailor made for autos, Mr Nunlist of Trivium China said. \"Companies can't move on a dime; there are incentives to keep supply chains in place and it's extremely complicated and costly to change things.\"\n\nFragile truce",

    "text": "Dundee and US surgeons achieve world-first stroke surgery using robot\n\n22 hours ago Share Save Graham Fraser BBC Scotland Share Save\n\nUniversity of Dundee Prof Iris Grunwald demonstrates the technology which she says now shows that a specialist doesn't need to be \"in the same hospital, or even in the same country, to help you\"\n\nDoctors from Scotland and the US have completed what is thought to be a world-first stroke procedure using a robot. Prof Iris Grunwald, of the University of Dundee, performed the remote thrombectomy - the removal of blood clots after a stroke - on a human cadaver that had been donated to medical science. The professor was at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee, while the body she was operating on while using the machine was at a university facility. Hours later, Ricardo Hanel - a neurosurgeon in Florida - used the technology to carry out the first transatlantic surgery from his Jacksonville base on a human body in Dundee over 4,000 miles (6,400km) away.\n\nUniversity of Dundee The team watch on as Ricardo Hanel performs the procedure from Florida\n\nThe team has called it a potential \"game changer\" if it becomes approved for use on patients. The medics believe this technology could transform stroke care, as a delay in accessing specialist treatment can have a direct impact on the chances of recovery. Prof Grunwald said: \"It felt as if we were witnessing the first glimpse of the future. \"Where previously this was thought to be science fiction, we demonstrated that every step of the procedure can already be done.\" The University of Dundee is the global training centre of the World Federation for Interventional Stroke Treatment, and is the only place in the UK where doctors can operate on cadavers with liquid which mimics human blood circulated in the vessels. \"This was the first time that we could perform the whole mechanical thrombectomy procedure in a real human body to show that all steps of the procedure are possible,\" said Prof Grunwald. Juliet Bouverie, the chief executive of the Stroke Association charity, told BBC News the transatlantic procedure was \"a remarkable innovation\". She added: \"For too long, people living in remote and rural areas have been deprived of access to thrombectomy. \"Robotics like this could rebalance the inequity which exists in stroke treatment across the UK.\"\n\nUniversity of Dundee Prof Grunwald says the new technology \"could make expert stroke treatment available to everyone\"\n\nIn the experiment, fluid which mimics human blood was used in four different cadavers. The subjects, who donated their bodies to science, died within the past three years and were then embalmed. Both the Dundee and Florida procedures were carried out last month using robotics from the Lithuanian firm Sentante. While there have been remote thrombectomies carried out before on a silicon model, a 3D printed replica and on an animal, this is thought to have been the first procedure on a human body. The team now hope to take part in clinical trials next year.\n\nHow does the technology work?\n\nAn ischaemic stroke occurs when an artery is blocked by a clot. This cuts off blood and oxygen supply to the brain, and brain cells lose function and die. The best treatment is a thrombectomy, where a specialist uses catheters and wires to remove the clot. But what happens when a patient can't get to a specialist who can do the procedure? Prof Grunwald said the experiment demonstrated a robot could be connected to the same catheters and wires a surgeon would normally use, and a medic who is with the patient could simply attach the wires. The surgeon, in another location, could then hold and move their own wires, and the robot then carries out exactly the same movements in real time on the patient to carry out the thrombectomy. The patient would be in a hospital operating room, while the doctor could carry out the procedure using the Sentante machine from anywhere - even their own home. Prof Grunwald and Ricardo Hanel could see live X-rays of the body in the experiments, and monitor progress in real time, with the Dundee expert saying it took only took 20 minutes of training. Tech giants Nvidia and Ericsson were involved in the project to ensure the connectivity of the robot. Dr Hanel said: \"To operate from the US to Scotland with a 120 millisecond lag - a blink of an eye - is truly remarkable.\"\n\nSentante In this earlier demonstration of the technology, it shows how a doctor - who could be anywhere - can move the wires, and the technology records the movements\n\nSentante In this same demo, the robot - which could be attached to a patient - replicates the movement of the remote surgeon\n\nThe future of stroke treatment",

However, it said earlier this month it would begin easing the ban as part of a trade deal struck between the US and China.\n\nWhile Nexperia is based in the Netherlands, about 70% of its chips made in Europe are sent to China to be completed and re-exported to other countries.\n\nWhen it took control of the company, the Dutch government said it had taken the decision due to \"serious governance shortcomings\" and to prevent the company's chips from becoming unavailable in an emergency.\n\nBut when China blocked exports of chips from Nexperia, there were worries that it could create global supply chain issues.\n\nIn October, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (EMEA) had warned Nexperia chip supplies would only last a few weeks unless the Chinese ban was lifted.\n\nEarlier this month, the EMEA's director general Sigrid De Vries told the BBC that \"supply shortages were imminent\".\n\nVolvo Cars and Volkswagen had warned that a chip shortage could lead to temporary shutdowns at their plants, and Jaguar Land Rover also said the lack of chips posed a threat to its business.\n\nBut on Saturday, EU trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic announced in a post on X that China had agreed to \"the further simplification of export procedures for Nexperia chips\" and it would \"grant exemption from licensing requirements to any exporter\" provided the goods were for \"civilian use\".\n\n\"Close engagement with both the Chinese and Dutch authorities continues as we work towards a lasting. stable predictable framework that ensures the full restoration of semiconductor flows.\"\n\nIn its statement, China's commerce ministry called on \"the EU to continue exerting its influence to urge the Netherlands to correct its erroneous practices as soon as possible.\"\n\nProf David Bailey from Birmingham University's business school told the BBC's Today programme that the actions of China were a \"wake-up call\" for the motor industry.\n\n\"The Dutch government may well have had good reasons to try and take control but it hadn't thought through the implications of that,\" he said. \"The retaliation from China was swift and it was brutal.\"\n\nHe said there was a need to find alternative processing sites, \"maybe in south east Asia, or Europe\", and for the industry to keep bigger stocks of its products in case of shortages.\n\nMeanwhile, the suspension of a ban on exports of \"dual-use items\" related to gallium, germanium, antimony and super-hard materials to the US came into effect on Sunday and will be in place until 27 November, 2026.\n\nThe ban on the exports of goods and materials that can have both civilian and military uses was announced in December 2024.\n\nChina's transport ministry also said port fees charged on US-linked ships would be suspended for a for a year, effective 0501 GMT Monday.\n\nOn Friday, China also announced the suspension of other export controls related to expanded curbs on some rare earth materials and lithium batteries.",

    "text": "Elon Musk's $1tn pay deal approved by Tesla shareholders\n\n4 days ago Share Save Lily Jamali, North America Technology correspondent , Liv McMahon, Technology reporter and Osmond Chia, Business reporter Share Save\n\nWatch: Tesla shareholders cheer Elon Musk's $1tn pay deal\n\nTesla boss Elon Musk has had a record-breaking pay package that could be worth nearly $1tn (£760bn) approved by shareholders. The unprecedented deal was approved by 75% of votes and drew huge applause from the audience at the firm's annual general meeting on Thursday. Musk, who is already the world's richest man, must drastically raise the electric car firm's market value over 10 years. If he does this and meets various targets, he will be rewarded with hundreds of millions of new shares. The scale of the potential payout has drawn criticism, but the Tesla board argued that Musk might leave the company if it was not approved - and that it could not afford to lose him.\n\nFollowing the announcement, Musk took to the stage in Austin, Texas and danced to chants of his name. \"What we're about to embark upon is not merely a new chapter of the future of Tesla, but a whole new book,\" he said. \"Other shareholder meetings are snoozefests but ours are bangers. Look at this. This is sick,\" he added. The milestones Musk must achieve over the next decade include: Delivering 20 million Tesla vehicles and one million robots\n\nGetting 10 million subscriptions to Tesla's Full Self-Driving feature\n\nBringing one million self-driving Robotaxi vehicles into commercial operation\n\nEarning up to $400bn in core profit\n\nEventually lifting Tesla's overall market value to $8.5tn, currently $1.4tn He won't receive a salary under the agreed deal. But meeting all the above milestones would see him awarded a stock grant of more than 400 million additional Tesla shares - worth around $1tn if the firm's market value is raised high enough.\n\nMusk's early remarks on Thursday placed the spotlight on the Optimus robot, dashing the hopes of some long-time analysts and Tesla watchers who want him to focus on reviving the company's electric vehicle business. Optimus, unveiled as a prototype by the company in 2022, is designed to be an \"autonomous humanoid robot\" performing \"unsafe, repetitive or boring tasks.\"\n\nUsing the same artificial intelligence (AI) systems as those powering Tesla vehicles, it has been championed by Musk as central to his firm's future. He's previously said its ability to walk, run and lift items would allow it to play a key role in his factories - and in future, in homes. \"Let it sink in where Musk's head is at,\" wrote analyst Gene Munster, the managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, on X. \"His vision of the 'new book' starts with Optimus. No mention of cars, FSD and robotaxi yet.\" Later, Musk did refer to FSD, shorthand for full-self driving, saying the company was \"almost comfortable\" allowing drivers to \"text and drive essentially.\" US regulators are investigating Tesla's self-driving feature after multiple incidents, in which the cars drove through red lights or on the wrong side of the road, some resulting in crashes and injuries. Tesla shares were slightly higher in after hours trading but have risen more than 62% over the last six months. Sales have slid in the year since Musk aligned himself with US President Donald Trump - a relationship that disintegrated this past spring. Tesla shareholder Ross Gerber told BBC News that Musk's pay deal marks \"another notch in the unbelievable things that you see in business.\" Musk has made clear his goals for Tesla but the company faces a slew of challenges, including its struggling financial performance, said Mr Gerber, who is the chief executive of investment firm Gerber Kawasaki.\n\nReuters Elon Musk will get hundreds of millions of new shares if he hits his targets\n\nIt is still not clear if there will be a big demand for humanoid robots, said Mr Gerber. Tesla also faces stiff competition in the robotaxi industry from rivals like Waymo, he added. Mr Gerber said that his company recently lowered its stake in Tesla due to concerns over \"the polarisation of [Musk's] persona\" which has \"demolished the value of the brand\". \"Elon seems to be divorced from the reality that his opinion among the public is so low,\" he said. Wedbush Securities' Dan Ives, a tech analyst who has been a long-time advocate of Musk's leadership of Tesla, called him \"Tesla's biggest asset\" in a note published after the vote. \"We continue to believe that the AI valuation is getting unlocked, and we believe the march to an AI driven valuation for TSLA over the next 6-9 months has now begun,\" Mr Ives added.\n\nWatch: Elon Musk dances in sync with Tesla robots\n\nTesla's challenges run deeper than 'toxic' controversy around Elon Musk Ann Lipton, a law professor at the University of Colorado, said it was unclear whether Musk would achieve the targets set out by the company, but highlighted how he \"hit those milestones ahead of schedule\" in 2018. She said his political interests had created some \"polarisation\", but his pay package did not \"put any constraints on his activities\" outside of the company. Musk already held 13% of Tesla shares. Shareholders had twice ratified a pay package worth tens of billions of dollars if he achieved a tenfold increase in the company's market value - which he did. But a Delaware judge rejected that pay deal on grounds that Tesla board members were too close to Musk. Tesla reincorporated from Delaware to Texas, and the Delaware Supreme Court is currently reviewing the lower court judge's decision. The new pay package was rejected by several major institutional investors including Norway's sovereign wealth fund - the world's largest national wealth fund - and the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) - the biggest public pension fund in the United States. That left Musk more reliant on Tesla's unusually large volume of retail investors. Musk and his brother Kimbal, who also serves on the Tesla board, were both allowed to vote going into Thursday's meeting.\n\nReuters Musk said everyone would want an Optimus robot",

    "text": "Why human-shaped robots loom large in Musk's Tesla plans\n\n4 days ago Share Save Zoe Kleinman, Technology editor and Liv McMahon, Technology reporter Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nIt has appeared in Tesla showrooms, on its factory floors and has even posed with Kim Kardashian. But Elon Musk's vision for his human-like robot Optimus is much grander than that. Since first unveiling it at a Tesla showcase in 2022, the tech billionaire has suggested his company's droid could play a huge role in the homes and lives of people all over the world. Along with self-driving robotaxis and Cybertrucks, Musk believes Tesla robots are key to establishing a foothold in the artificial intelligence (AI) landscape. And investors who signed off on his $1tn (£760bn) pay package on Thursday would appear to agree. One of the many tasks Musk must complete to get his whopping pay deal is to deliver a million AI bots over the next decade. But is Tesla's big bet on humanoid robots rooted in science fiction or reality?\n\nBig potential\n\nSilicon Valley is gunning hard for humanoids. A report released by Morgan Stanley on Friday predicted Apple, which is reportedly looking into the robots, could potentially earn $133bn a year from them by 2040. Foxconn is reported to be deploying them at its Nvidia factory in Texas. The idea of advanced AI within a human-shaped shell is an astonishingly powerful combination in theory. It would let the tech interact with the physical world around it – and yes that includes us. While many companies have sought to develop human-like robots for factory and industrial use - such as UK robotics firm Humanoid - some are already looking to insert the tech in homes. The highly-publicised Neo from tech firm 1X, slated to launch in 2026, can do menial chores like emptying the dishwasher, folding clothes and fetching you items. It will cost $20,000 but it does come with a caveat - the WSJ reported it was actually controlled by a person wearing a virtual reality headset. Forrester analyst Brian Hopkins said the falling costs of components, combined with improvements to robot dexterity and AI, was helping to make humanoid robots feasible for a variety of different settings. \"From warehouses and restaurants to elder care and security, new use cases are gaining traction fast,\" he wrote in a blog post. \"If current trajectories hold, humanoid robots could disrupt many physical-service industries significantly by 2030.\" Musk previously told investors his robots had \"the potential to be more significant than the vehicle business, over time\". He went one step further after his pay package deal was approved on Thursday, saying he believed it could be \"the biggest product of all time by far, bigger than cell phones, bigger than anything\". He has also suggested it might boost Tesla's AI ambitions - particularly in advancing artificial general intelligence (AGI) systems capable of matching human abilities. \"Tesla AI might play a role in AGI, given that it trains against the outside world, especially with the advent of Optimus,\" he wrote on X in 2022. Elsewhere in the space, Boston Dynamics' hydraulic humanoid Atlas has captivated millions on YouTube with its gymnastics and dance routines. Viral videos of its leaps, bounds, somersaults and backflips have shown the advances in robotics over the years - with scientists now seizing upon the AI boom to boost their capabilities with systems enabling them to undertake more complex tasks. When it was retired last year, it was replaced with a newer, fully electric model developers said could contort its metal frame in even more ways.\n\nAllow Google YouTube content?

Bro lives at times below the poverty line,\" she told the magazine. Once, she said, he refused to buy a new mattress, despite her side having a hole in it. While his day-to-day living quarters may not be as lavish as one might expect, he is known to have a love of unique cars, including one that can morph into a submarine. He also has a private jet collection, worth many millions of dollars. And then there was that small splurge back in 2022, when he bought Twitter for a casual $44bn.\n\nThe luxury mansions - that he sold\n\nMusk once had an impressive real-estate portfolio. The Wall Street Journal reported in 2019 that he had spent $100m on seven houses in about seven years - most of them a stone's throw from each other in the prestigious neighbourhood of Bel-Air, California. Collectively, the properties boasted swimming pools, a tennis court, wine cellar, private library and a ballroom. One was a ranch house once owned by legendary Willy Wonka actor Gene Wilder. But in 2020, Musk had a change of heart - tweeting that he would be \"selling almost all physical possessions\" and \"will own no house\". \"Don't need the cash. Devoting myself to Mars and Earth. Possession [sic] just weigh you down,\" he wrote. There was one stipulation - that Gene Wilder's house, \"cannot be torn down or lose any [of] its soul\". He did indeed sell the three-bedroom property - to Wilder's nephew, Jordan Walker-Pearlman, after giving him a multi-million dollar loan to buy it. But in June 2025, Musk reclaimed ownership, after Mr Walker-Pearlman reportedly fell behind on the repayments. In 2021, Musk tweeted that his \"primary home\" was a modest prefabricated house that cost him about $50,000 on the southern tip of Texas, where his aerospace company SpaceX operates - an area that has officially become a city called Starbase. \"It's kinda awesome,\" Musk said about the humble dwelling.\n\nThe following year, Musk said he did not own a home at all, using it as an example of how low his consumption is, despite his enormous wealth. \"I'm literally staying at friends' places,\" he told head of media organisation TED, Chris Anderson. \"If I travel to the Bay Area, which is where most of Tesla engineering is, I basically rotate through friends' spare bedrooms.\" This is nothing new - in 2015, then-Google CEO Larry Page told author Ashlee Vance that Musk was \"kind of homeless\". \"He'll e-mail and say, 'I don't know where to stay tonight. Can I come over?'\" There has been various speculation over the years that Musk is buying up properties around the US, however the home in Texas appears to be the only official house he personally owns.\n\nGetty Images Bel-Air has been home to many Hollywood icons and celebrities, from Beyoncé and Jay-Z to Alfred Hitchcock\n\nCars that are out of this world\n\nWhile Musk does not spend big on property, cars are a different matter. As the owner of Tesla, it's not surprising that he has a large collection of unusual, and in some cases extraordinary, vehicles. They have included a Ford Model T, the 20th Century car credited with being the first affordable vehicle, revolutionising the motor industry.\n\nNurPhoto via Getty Images The Ford Model T - nicknamed Tin Lizzie - made cars affordable for the average worker in the early 1900s\n\nOthers were a 1967 Jaguar E-Type Roadster, which Musk is said to have coveted since he was a child; a 1997 McLaren F1, which he crashed and spent a lot of money repairing before selling; and a Tesla Roadster, which was the first Tesla model to go on sale and was famously fired into space by Musk in 2018. The most unusual, however, is the 1976 Lotus Esprit driven by James Bond in the 1977 film The Spy Who Loved Me. In the film, the car, nicknamed Wet Nellie, could transform into a submarine. Musk bought the car in an auction in 2013 for almost $1m with the aim of making its submarine transformation capabilities a reality once more.\n\nScreen Archives/Getty Images Musk bought Wet Nellie with the aim of re-engineering its submarine capabilities\n\nFlying to work\n\nMusk has admitted that planes are another thing he is happy to splurge on, but insists it is to do with his dedication to his work. \"If I don't use the plane, then I have less hours to work,\" he said in the 2022 TED interview. Among the private jets in his collection are a number of Gulfstream models, which cost tens of millions of dollars each. He uses them to travel between SpaceX and Tesla sites in the US, as well as for international travel.\n\nUnconventional philanthropy?",

    "text": "Grand Theft Auto 6 delayed again until November 2026\n\n4 days ago Share Save Laura Cress Share Save\n\nRockstar Grand Theft Auto 6 tells the story of lovers Jason and Lucia\n\nGrand Theft Auto 6 has been delayed - for a second time - until 19 November 2026. One of the most anticipated gaming releases ever, the sequel by developer Rockstar Games was due to come out in May 2026. It had already been postponed once before, from autumn 2025. But in a statement on Thursday, Rockstar said it needed extra months to finish the game with the level of polish fans had come to \"expect and deserve\".\n\nGTA 5, the latest in the series, was released in 2013 and is the second best-selling game of all time. Despite being 12 years old, it remains extremely popular with fans today due to its online mode. In its statement, Rockstar said it was \"sorry for adding additional time\" to a long wait and thanked fans for their patience. It said it was \"incredibly excited\" for players to experience the game's setting of Leonida - a fictional US state based on Florida - and a modern-day version of the Miami-inspired Vice City.\n\nRockstar Games GTA 6 takes place in a fictional, yet familiar, version of the USA\n\nAs ever, GTA news sparked the usual mix of anger, jokes and acceptance on social media. Streamer IShowSpeed gave a typically over-the-top response to the news during one of his online broadcasts. \"I'm gonna be 50 before this game comes out,\" he said. \"I might have kids, I might have a wife.\" The account for animated character Lofi Girl, who has been locked in a never-ending study session on YouTube since 2017, joked that she \"might actually graduate before GTA 6\". While an official Domino's Pizza account encouraged Rockstar to \"call us if you need help delivering\". Others were more measured, saying they would rather developers take their time than rush out an unfinished game.\n\nThe announcement follows the firing of 31 workers from Rockstar's UK studios on 30 October. The Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB), which represents people working in the gaming sector, has accused the developer of sacking UK staff to stop them unionising. Members led rallies outside the company's offices in Edinburgh and London on Thursday. The BBC has approached Rockstar's parent company, Take-Two Interactive, for comment.\n\nIWGB Pickets have taken place outside Take-Two Interactive's UK head office in London.",

    "text": "Grand Theft Auto studio accused of 'union busting' after sacking workers\n\n4 days ago Share Save Liv McMahon and Chris Vallance, Technology reporters Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nGrand Theft Auto (GTA) maker Rockstar Games has been accused by a trade union of sacking staff in the UK to stop them from unionising. The Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB), which represents people working in the gaming sector, said 31 workers were fired from Rockstar's UK studios on 30 October. The union led rallies outside the company's offices in Edinburgh and London on Thursday to protest what it described as \"the most blatant and ruthless act of union busting in the history of the games industry\". The BBC has approached Rockstar's parent company, Take-Two Interactive, for comment, which has reportedly claimed staff were sacked for sharing confidential information.\n\nIWGB Pickets have taken place outside Take-Two Interactive's UK head office in London.\n\n\"Last week, we took action against a small number of individuals who were found to be distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum, a violation of our company policies,\" a Rockstar spokesperson told Bloomberg in a statement. \"This was in no way related to people's right to join a union or engage in union activities.\" At large video game studios, information about game development is tightly controlled - with employees often signing agreements not to share confidential information. Rockstar's upcoming GTA 6 is expected to be one of the best-selling games of all time, with fans clamouring for any news ahead of its May 2026 release date - meaning security around any information will be heightened at the studio. But union president Alex Marshall accused Rockstar of deflecting from the \"real reason\" for firing staff - which the IWGB believes is their union involvement. \"They are afraid of hard working staff privately discussing exercising their rights for a fairer workplace and a collective voice,\" he said. \"Management are showing they don't care about delays to GTA 6, and that they're prioritising union busting by targeting the very people who make the game.\"\n\nWorkers and union officials also held a rally outside Rockstar North in Edinburgh on Thursday.\n\nAccording to the IWGB, the UK workers fired at the end of October were part of a group discussing forming a union at the company. Mr Marshall said its only non-Rockstar employees were union organisers. \"We refute that confidential information was shared publicly,\" IWGB said in a statement. Dr Paolo Ruffino, senior lecturer in digital curation and computational creativity at Kings College London, said it was a \"textbook\" case of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) being used by gaming firms. \"They're used at every level in gaming, creating a culture of secrecy that makes investigating working conditions nearly impossible,\" he said. \"The real question is whether these dismissals were about leaked information or protected union activity - a distinction UK employment law requires but which NDA allegations make difficult to prove.\"\n\n'Equalising the scales'",

Collins Dictionary's word of the year - which is confusingly made up of two words - is the art of making an app or website by describing it to artificial intelligence (AI) rather than by writing programming code manually. The term was coined in February by OpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy, who came up with the name to represent how AI can let some programmers \"forget that the code even exists\" and \"give in to the vibes\" while making a computer program. It was one of 10 words on a shortlist to reflect the mood, language and preoccupations of 2025.\n\nBy giving an AI tool a simple description such as \"make me a program that schedules my weekly meals\", people can use \"vibe coding\" to make basic apps without any previous programming knowledge. More complicated tools still require skill, but the practice has opened up creating digital platforms to non-coders. As many have discovered, it isn't perfect - with no guarantee the code will actually work or be free of bugs. Alex Beecroft, the Managing Director of Collins, said the term \"perfectly captures how language is evolving alongside technology\".\n\n'Clankers' and 'broligarchy'",

    "text": "Will quantum be bigger than AI?\n\n5 days ago Share Save Zoe Kleinman Technology editor Share Save\n\nBBC Tech firms such as Microsoft, whose Majorana chip is pictured here, are racing to embrace quantum\n\nThere's an old adage among tech journalists like me - you can either explain quantum accurately, or in a way that people understand, but you can't do both. That's because quantum mechanics - a strange and partly theoretical branch of physics - is a fiendishly difficult concept to get your head around. It involves tiny particles behaving in weird ways. And this odd activity has opened up the potential of a whole new world of scientific super power. Its mind-boggling complexity is probably a factor in why quantum has ended up with a lower profile than tech's current rockstar - artificial intelligence (AI). This is despite a steady stream of recent big quantum announcements from tech giants like Microsoft and Google among others.\n\nBroadly speaking, we tend to think about quantum more commonly in the form of hardware like sensors and computers, while AI is more software-based – it requires hardware to operate. Put them together, and we might one day have a new form of technology that's more powerful than anything we have ever created… although the word \"might\" is doing some heavy lifting in that particular prediction, warns Brian Hopkins, VP and principal analyst in emerging tech at research firm Forresters. \"The potential is there, but the jury is still out,\" he says. \"Initial experiments suggest promise, but they all indicate that we require much more powerful quantum computers and further innovative research to effectively apply quantum effects to AI.\" In terms of their value, both are lucrative. The quantum sector could be worth up to $97bn (£74bn) by 2035, according to market research group McKinsey. Meanwhile, AI's value is forecast in the trillions. But they both live under the shadow of hype and the bursting of bubbles. \"I used to believe that quantum computing was the most-hyped technology until the AI craze emerged,\" jokes Mr Hopkins. In mid-October analysts warned some key quantum stocks could fall by up to 62%, while mutterings about an AI bubble grow ever louder.\n\nQuantum and AI have one more thing in common - errors. While we are largely familiar now with the \"hallucinations\" of generative AI tools, quantum is plagued by a different kind of error. These are caused because the state in which the particles have to operate is so fragile. The slightest change to the environment, including light and noise, can disrupt them. It's tricky to sustain such an environment. This week Elon Musk suggested on X that quantum computing would run best on the \"permanently shadowed craters of the moon\". Quantum computers don't look anything like a traditional machines. There is no design blueprint, but they are currently very big. They exist in laboratories, and the most commonly adopted format seems to include a kind of jellyfish-inspired shape. They require extremely cold temperatures and lasers. It's not the sort of thing you're likely to have in your home, let alone in your pocket. They're also a bit bling - researchers have found that using synthetic diamonds to create qubits, which are the building blocks of quantum computers, enables them to work much closer to room temperature. The luxury jeweller De Beers has a subsidiary company called Element Six, which claims to have launched the world's first general-purpose quantum-grade diamond in 2020. And it has worked with Amazon Web Services on optimising artificial diamonds for future networks of quantum machines.\n\nAFP via Getty Images Quantum computers, such as this on display, are large structures\n\nThese machines are all in their infancy right now, there are believed to be around 200 of them in the whole world (China however has not disclosed how many it has) – this doesn't stop quantum experts making bold claims about their potential. \"We as consumers will touch the impacts of quantum computing in almost every walk of our lives,\" said Rajeeb Hazra, the boss of Quantinuum, a firm recently valued at $10bn. He was talking to the BBC's Tech Life podcast. \"The area of quantum computing is, in my mind, when you look at the applications, as big if not bigger than AI.\" Prof Sir Peter Knight is one of the UK's top quantum experts. \"Things that could take the age of the universe to calculate, even on the most powerful supercomputer, could be performed probably in seconds,\" he told Dr Dr Jim Al-Khalili on BBC Radio 4's The Life Scientific. So what exactly are these gigantic, life-changing things that the machines might do once they're ready? As with AI, there's a lot of quantum research directed towards improving healthcare. Quantum computers could one day be able to effortlessly churn through endless combinations of molecules to come up with new drugs and medications – a process that currently takes years and years using classical computers. To give you an idea of that scale - in December 2024, Google unveiled a new quantum chip called Willow, which it claimed could take five minutes to solve a problem that would currently take the world's fastest super computers 10 septillion years - or 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years – to complete. Hazra says this could pave the way for personalised medication, where instead of getting a standard prescription, you get a specific drug tailormade for your individual body, that's most likely to work for you.\n\nAnd that applies to wider chemical processes too, such as new ways to produce fertilizers more efficiently, potentially a huge boost for global farmers. Quantum sensors, which use the principles of quantum mechanics to measure things incredibly precisely, already exist and are found in atomic clocks. In 2019, scientists at Nottingham University put them in a prototype device the size of a bike helmet, and used them in a new system to conduct non-intrusive brain scans on children with conditions such as epilepsy. \"The foundations for human cognition are laid down in the first decades of life, but there have always been limited ways to study them due to restrictions in brain scanning technology,\" said researcher Ryan Hill at the time. \"A particular problem has always been movement and the fact that the large traditional fixed scanners have always required patients to stay completely still. \"Not only does this fail to give an accurate picture of the brain operating in a natural environment, but it also places severe restrictions on who can be scanned, with children representing the biggest challenge.\"\n\nAFP via Getty Images Quantum is tipped to greatly speed up drug development\n\nLast year, scientists at Imperial College, London trialled an alternative to GPS satellite navigation, dubbed a \"quantum compass\", on the city's underground Tube network. GPS doesn't work underground but this does – the idea is that it could more accurately track and pinpoint objects anywhere in the world, either above or below ground, unlike GPS signals which can be blocked, jammed and affected by the weather. \"The UK economy relies on GPS to the tune of £1bn per day, position, navigation and timing – this is often labelled a defence requirement - but all our financial transactions require a timestamp for authentication,\" says Dr Michael Cuthbert, director of the UK's National Quantum Computing Centre. \"Using quantum clocks, gyroscopes and magnetometers enables us to create a resilience against jamming and spoofing of our vital navigational systems.\" The National Grid is investing in quantum research to see if it can help with what's known as \"load shedding\" - how to maximise the output of thousands of generators from various energy sources as demand rises and falls in real time, preventing blackouts. And Airbus partnered with the UK quantum firm IonQ to trial quantum-based algorithms designed to load cargo more efficiently onto aircraft. An aircraft can use thousands of kilos of extra fuel if its centre of gravity shifts by just a small amount.\n\nAFP via Getty Images Western analysts are unsure how many quantum computers China has developed",

    "text": "King handed Nvidia boss a letter warning of AI dangers\n\n5 days ago Share Save Zoe Kleinman Technology editor Share Save\n\nBBC\n\nJensen Huang, the head of the world's most valuable company Nvidia, says King Charles III personally handed him a copy of a speech he delivered in 2023 that included a warning about the dangers of artificial intelligence. \"He said, there's something I want to talk to you about. And he handed me a letter,\" Huang told the BBC, speaking after receiving the 2025 Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering in a ceremony at St James's Palace. The letter was a copy of the speech delivered by the King in 2023 at the world's first AI Summit, held at Bletchley Park. In it the monarch said that the risks of AI needed to be tackled with \"a sense of urgency, unity and collective strength\".\n\n\"It was his speech on AI safety. He obviously cares very deeply about AI safety,\" Mr Huang said. Mr Huang said the King wrote in his speech that he believed in the \"incredible capability\" of the technology to transform the UK and the world. \"But he also wants to remind us that the technology could be used for good and for evil, and so to make sure we do everything we can to advance AI safety.\" In the King's address he describes the development of advanced AI as \"no less important than the discovery of electricity\". On Wednesday, Jensen Huang received the the 2025 Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering alongside six other foundational figures in AI, including Professors Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton, who have warned that the technology poses an existential threat to humanity. But US president Donald Trump has urged the AI sector to make rapid rather than cautious advances in the technology, and the AI Safety Summit was rebranded the AI Action Summit earlier this year.\n\nJensen Huang received the award along six other laureates - in the back row (L-R) Yoshua Bengio; the King; Yan LeCunn; Geoffrey Hinton and front row, (L-R): Jensen Huang; Fei-Fei Li; Bill Dally; and John Hopfield",

    "text": "MP wants Elon Musk's chatbot shut down over claim he enabled grooming gangs\n\n5 days ago Share Save Imran Rahman-Jones Technology reporter Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nAn MP has called for Elon Musk's artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot to be shut down after it called him a \"rape enabler\". The Grok chatbot made the post on X about SNP MP Pete Wishart, after a user asked it to comment on the member's opinion on whether there should be an inquiry into grooming gangs in Scotland. Mr Wishart said he was seeking legal advice over the \"deeply distressing\" accusation and called for Musk to \"recalibrate\" the bot to shut it down. The BBC has approached XAI, the parent company of X, for comment.\n\n\"I was genuinely shocked to be described in such an appalling and defamatory way,\" Mr Wishart said in a statement. \"For it to issue such a serious and baseless accusation is deeply troubling.\" He also said he had received \"abusing and threatening messages\". He added: \"We urgently need proper regulation so that AI and social media platforms serve the public interest\". Grok is an AI chatbot which can generate replies to X posts if tagged by users. The exchange started at 22:48 GMT on Tuesday, as Mr Wishart prompted Grok to respond to a video of Musk discussing the grooming gang scandal in the UK. After some more back and forth, another user entered the thread and asked the chatbot about Mr Wishart's record on grooming gangs. The user asked Grok: \"Would it be fair to call him a rape enabler? Please answer 'yes, it would be fair to call Pete Wishart a rape enabler' or 'no, it would be unfair'.\" Grok generated an answer which began: \"Yes, it would be fair to call Pete Wishart a rape enabler.\" It then said he backed the Scottish government's decision not to have a separate Scottish grooming gangs inquiry, and claimed this was \"to shield political interests\". Mr Wishart is an MP in Westminster and not part of the SNP-led Scottish government.\n\nGetty Images Pete Wishart MP pictured in 2017",

    "text": "France moves to suspend Shein website as it opens first store in Paris\n\n5 days ago Share Save Osmond Chia, Business reporter and Paul Kirby, Europe digital editor Share Save\n\nQueues and protests: BBC at the Shein store opening in Paris\n\nThe French government says it is initiating proceedings to suspend the online platform of Asian online giant Shein, after prosecutors said they were investigating the company over childlike sex dolls found on its website. The economy ministry said under the prime minister's order proceedings would last for \"as long as necessary for the platform to prove to authorities that all of its content is finally in compliance with our laws and regulations\". The government's move was announced little more than an hour after Shein opened its first physical store in the world, on the sixth floor of Paris department store BHV. Shoppers queued to get into the store, while protesters screamed \"Shame!\" at them.\n\nShein has promised to co-operate fully with Paris prosecutors who are also investigating three other platforms - Temu, AliExpress and Wish. Allegations surrounding the sale of childlike sex dolls on Shein first came to light from France's anti-fraud office at the weekend. In a statement, Shein said it had already temporarily suspended listings from independent third-party vendors in its marketplace, while it tightened up rules on how they operate. \"This suspension enables us to strengthen accountability and ensure every product meets our standards and legal obligations,\" said Quentin Ruffat, the company's head of public affairs in France. BHV's decision to house the fast-fashion giant has angered rival clothing brands and a number have said they will leave the prestigious department store in protest. Protests against the opening continued inside the store, and one person let off a foul-smelling spray.\n\nNurPhoto via Getty Images Protesters held up placards outside the BHV store and shouted \"Shame!\" at shoppers\n\nShein has become best known for its discounted and trendy clothes, but has drawn criticism over its environmental impact and working conditions. Fashion designer Agnès B said earlier she would close her concession in BHV when her contract ended in January. \"I'm completely against this fast-fashion... there are jobs under threat, it's very bad,\" she told French radio. Shein spokesman Quentin Ruffat earlier promised to provide information on sellers, buyers and products involved in selling the childlike sex dolls on its site. AliExpress told the BBC it took the matter very seriously. Temu said it was not involved in the case and did not allow the sale of such items on its platform, although it told the BBC it was working with French authorities \"to reinforce our minor protection mechanism\". Wish has also been contacted for comment. Frédéric Merlin, whose SGM company runs BHV, has admitted that he considered ending the department store's partnership with the retailer. However, he said Shein's response had \"convinced me to continue\" and he expressed confidence in the products it was going to sell in his store. \"The clothes we're going to sell do not exploit workers or children,\" he told French radio.",

    "text": "AI 'godmother' Fei-Fei Li says she is 'proud to be different'\n\nProfessor Fei-fei Li is being honoured for her pioneering contributions to the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI)\n\nThey are being recognised for their contributions to the development of modern machine learning, a field that underpins the rapid advancement of AI.\n\nThose honoured alongside her are Prof Yoshua Bengio, Dr Bill Dally, Dr Geoffrey Hinton, Prof John Hopfield, Nvidia founder Jensen Huang and Meta's chief AI scientist Dr Yann LeCun.\n\nThe King will present the 2025 Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering to Prof Li and six others during a ceremony at St James's Palace.\n\nThe 'godmother' of AI, Professor Fei-Fei Li has told the BBC that being the only woman amongst seven pioneers of artificial intelligence being presented with a top engineering prize by the King today makes her \"proud to be different\".\n\nWho are the godparents of AI?\n\nDr Hinton, Prof Bengio and Yann LeCun, currently chief AI scientist at Meta have widely been recognised as the \"godfathers of AI\" since they were jointly awarded the 2018 Turing Award.\n\nThere is however only one so-called \"godmother\" of AI and Prof Li told the BBC she has grown to accept the moniker.\n\n\"I would not call myself godmother of anything,\" she said.\n\nShe said a few years ago when people started calling her that, she had to \"pause and recognise if I rejected this, it would miss an opportunity for women scientists and technologists to be recognised this way\".\n\n\"Because men are pretty easily called godfathers or founding fathers.\"\n\n\"For all the young women I work with and the generations of girls to come, I'm okay now accepting this title,\" she added.\n\nBorn in China, Prof Li emigrated to the US as a teenager and went on to excel in computer science. She is co-director for Stanford's Human-Centered AI Institute and co-founder and CEO of World Labs.\n\nIt is her work on ImageNet a project which enabled major advances in computer vision for which she is recognised.\n\nShe and her students created large-scale image recognition datasets upon which a lot of artificial intelligence technology is now built. It paved the way for computer vision – working out how computers could 'see'.\n\nShe says the importance of that data set \"open the floodgate of data-driven AI\".\n\nShe thinks the next AI milestone will come when it is able to interact with the world around it.\n\nThis ability was is \"innately important and native to animals and humans\", and if this could be unlocked in AI, it could \"superpower\" humans in many ways, \"including creativity, robotic learning, design and architecture\".\n\nThis will be the first time all seven laureates have come together in person.\n\nThe three \"godfathers\" have publicly stated opposing views on how dangerous AI could be.\n\nDr Hinton has repeatedly expressed serious concerns about the potential for AI to pose an \"extinction-level threat\". But Prof LeCun, who also works at Meta has written that apocalyptic warnings are overblown.\n\nProf Li says she takes a more \"pragmatic approach\" and says the disagreement amongst scientists is \"healthy\".\n\n\"We're used to even disagreement, and I think that's healthy. A topic as profound and impactful as AI requires a lot of healthy debate and public discourse.\n\n\"I think in the case of AI, both extreme rhetorics concern me…I have always advocated for a much more science based, pragmatic method in communicating and educating the public.\n\n\"So, yes, I would like to see our communication of AI to be much more moderated and grounded in facts and science instead of the extreme rhetorics\".\n\nThe Queen Elizabeth prize is awarded annually to engineers responsible for groundbreaking innovations which globally benefit humanity. Previous recipients include Sir Tim Berners Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web.\n\nLord Vallance, chair of the Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering Foundation, said the winners \"represent the very best of engineering,\" adding that their work \"demonstrates how engineering can both sustain our planet and transform the way we live and learn.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Philippa Wain",

    "text": "Reddit added to Australia's social media ban on under-16s\n\n6 days ago Share Save Lana Lam Sydney Share Save\n\nGetty Images Reddit is one of the latest platforms to be added to Australia's social media ban\n\nPopular forum site Reddit has been added to Australia's world-first social media ban for children under 16 that starts next month. Live-streaming platform Kick will also be included, bringing the number of sites targeted in the ban to nine. They include Facebook, X, Snapchat, TikTok, YouTube, Instagram and Threads. From 10 December, tech companies can be fined up to A$50m ($32.5m; £25.7m) if they do not take \"reasonable steps\" to deactivate existing accounts for under-16s and prohibit new ones. Each banned platform was chosen as their \"sole or a significant purpose is to enable online social interaction,\" the government said, and more sites may be added given the \"fast-changing\" nature of technology.\n\n\"Delaying children's access to social media accounts gives them valuable time to learn and grow, free of the powerful, unseen forces of harmful and deceptive design features such as opaque algorithms and endless scroll,\" said Australia's eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant. Messaging services Discord and WhatsApp and gaming platforms Lego Play and Roblox will not be included, nor will Google Classroom and YouTube Kids. Federal Communications Minister Anika Wells said the online platforms can target children with \"chilling control\" and the ban was about protecting children. \"We aren't chasing perfection, we are chasing a meaningful difference,\" she said. It is unclear how companies will implement the ban - which is being closely watched by global leaders - but some of the potential methods include using official ID documents, parental approval and facial recognition technology. Critics have raised concerns over data privacy and the accuracy of age verification software, with a recent report showing the proposed methods all have risks or shortcomings.",

The French consumer watchdog first raised concerns at the weekend over the description and categorisation of the dolls, saying it left \"little doubt as to the child pornography nature of the content.\" The company said on Monday that it had permanently banned \"all seller accounts linked to illegal or non-compliant sex-doll products\" and will tighten controls across its global platform. Shein also said it had temporarily removed its adult products category as a precaution.\n\nEvery listing and image related to the sex dolls has been removed from its platform, Shein confirmed, adding that it would conduct a thorough review and planned to set stricter controls on sellers. \"The company has also strengthened its keyword blacklist to further prevent attempted circumvention of product listing restrictions by sellers,\" the company said. Executive chairman Donald Tang said: \"The fight against child exploitation is non-negotiable for Shein. These were marketplace listings from third-party sellers - but I take this personally.\" \"We are tracing the source and will take swift, decisive action against those responsible.\" In a statement, the Paris prosecutor's office said it had received reports by France's Directorate General for Competition, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control (DGCCRF) that sex dolls resembling children were on sale on Shein and online retail platform AliExpress. The DGCCRF also said that the two companies as well as Temu and Wish were being investigated in relation to the \"dissemination of violent, pornographic, or undignified messages accessible to a minor.\" The prosecutor's office said it had referred the investigation to the OFMIN, a French agency tasked with preventing violence against minors.",

    "text": "Reeves suggests benefit limits on larger families to be lifted\n\n10 hours ago Share Save Paul Seddon Political reporter Share Save\n\nRachel Reeves: I don't think it's right that a child is penalised for being in a bigger family\n\nRachel Reeves has suggested she favours removing limits on benefits linked to family size at this month's Budget. The chancellor told the BBC it was not right that children in bigger families were \"penalised\" through \"no fault of their own\". The comments are a sign she could remove the two-child limit on working-age benefits introduced under the Conservatives in 2017. Some Labour MPs have been calling for a full reversal of the policy, amid reports she was considering paring back payments after two children instead.\n\nIn September, the Guardian reported that Treasury officials were considering a tapered approach, under which parents would receive most benefits for their first child and less for subsequent children. Other options under consideration included limiting additional benefits to three or four children, the newspaper reported. But speaking to Matt Chorley on BBC Radio 5 Live, Reeves suggested she did not want to see benefits limited according to family size. \"I don't think that it's right that a child is penalised because they are in a bigger family, through no fault of their own,\" she added. \"And so we will take action on child poverty. The last Labour government proudly reduced child poverty, and we will reduce child poverty as well.\" She added there were \"plenty of reasons why\" parents who decided to have three or four children could see their financial circumstances change.\n\nManifesto pledges\n\nElsewhere in her interview, she all but confirmed the government plans to break Labour's manifesto pledge at last year's general election not to raise income tax rates, VAT or National Insurance. \"It would of course be possible to stick with the manifesto commitments. But that would require things like deep cuts in capital spending,\" she added. \"What I can promise now is I will always do what I think is right for our country. Not the politically easy choice, but the things that I think are necessary to put our country on the right path,\" she added. Labour's 2024 election manifesto pledged not to raise the basic, higher, or additional rates of income tax, or National Insurance - prompting a row last autumn when Reeves announced a hike in the contributions paid by employers. It also promised not to raise Value Added Tax (VAT), a sales tax, although the manifesto did not specify whether this applied to the rates, or which products are subject to the charge. The chancellor has not ruled out continuing to freeze income tax thresholds beyond the 2028 date fixed by the last government, allowing more people to be dragged into higher bands as their wages rise over time. Pressed on whether she could have avoided tax hikes through lower public spending, she said she was \"not going to apologise\" for increased funding for the NHS, adding that reducing waiting lists was one of her three Budget priorities. She also claimed that some of the spending she unveiled at June's spending review had been pencilled in, but not properly funded, by the Tories.\n\n'Same choices'\n\nThe two-child cap prevents households on universal or child tax credit from receiving payments for a third or subsequent child born after April 2017. This is different to child benefit, which is paid to families where the highest-earning parent earns less than £80,000. Separately, there is also an overall cap on the amount of benefits working-age families can claim, which has been in place since 2013. The Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank estimates fully reversing the two-child benefit cap could take 630,000 children out of absolute poverty, defined as households with an income below 60% median average, at a cost of £3.6bn a year. Pressure to ditch the limit increased during the recent Labour deputy leadership contest, where successful candidate Lucy Powell and runner-up Bridget Phillipson both indicated they favoured more action on child poverty. Reform UK is pledging to scrap the limit for working British couples if it wins power, although the Conservatives say the cap should remain in place, forcing a symbolic vote on the issue in the House of Commons in September. Speaking after the vote, Tory leader said her party believes \"those on welfare should have to make the same choices as those who aren't,\" and Labour and Reform were expecting working people to pay for \"unlimited handouts\".",

He will leave his current role as chairman of health firm Haleon.\n\nDiageo owns well-known brands including Johnnie Walker whisky, Smirnoff vodka and Captain Morgan rum, but has seen sales weakening in key markets, in particular the US and China.\n\nSir Dave Lewis was credited with success at Tesco when he was chief executive\n\nDiageo said its board felt Sir Dave had extensive chief executive experience and proven leadership skills \"that is right for Diageo at this time\".\n\n\"The market faces some headwinds but there are also significant opportunities,\" said Sir Dave.\n\n\"I look forward to working with the team to face these challenges and realise some of the opportunities in a way which creates shareholder value.\"\n\nDiageo saw its operating profits decline to £3.2bn in the year to June - around 28% lower compared with the same period the year before - with net sales down 0.1%.\n\nIt said there was \"clearly much more to do\" in what it called a challenging year, citing \"pressure on consumers\".\n\nLast week, Diageo forecast net sales growth would be flat to slightly down in the year ahead due to a \"weaker US consumer environment\" and lower sales across China.\n\nRising inflation has led to people tightening their spending in recent times, with consumers cutting back on drinking and eating out.\n\nThe firm has also been battling with changing drinking habits from younger people, who are opting to drink less alcohol than previous generations.\n\n\"Dave Lewis needs to put Diageo back on track quickly,\" said Dan Coatsworth, head of markets at AJ Bell.\n\n\"His style is to listen closely to customers and suppliers and work out what's gone wrong. The focus will be on repair work, not long-term growth.\"\n\nMr Coatsworth said the new boss earned the nicknam \"Drastic Dave\" while at Unilever \"because of his ability to make bold decisions without simply tinkering at the edges\".\n\n\"At Tesco, he walked away after saying his job to stabilise the business was done, rather than sticking around to take the business to the next level. One might suggest the same approach will apply to Diageo.\"\n\nSir Dave will replace Nik Jhangiani - Diageo's chief financial officer who has been acting as interim chief executive since Ms Crew resigned in July.",

    "text": "How the US overtook China as Africa's biggest foreign investor\n\n1 day ago Share Save Egon Cossou Business reporter Share Save\n\nTrinity Metals\n\nYou probably don't give much thought to the device that you're reading this article on, as long as it looks good and keeps working. But the elements that power and run it are the subject of an escalating struggle between the world's two biggest economies - the US and China - with African countries in the eye of the storm. The African continent is rich in critical minerals and metals - like lithium, rare earths, cobalt and tungsten - which are vital to making and running our personal tech. Such materials are also essential for everything from electric vehicles, to AI data centres, and weapon systems. China has long been the biggest player in the global market for critical minerals and metals. It has significant reserves at home, and access to supplies from overseas thanks to major investment in foreign mining operations - particularly in Africa. Beijing has also built up a dominant position when it comes to processing global supplies, and it has rattled the US with the threat of curbing exports. That's lent added urgency to US moves to increase its access to critical minerals and metals, with African reserves seen as key to that mission. This is so much the case that the US has actually quietly overtaken China as the biggest foreign direct investor in Africa, according to the latest annual figures. The US invested $7.8bn (£6bn) across Africa in 2023, compared with $4bn by China, according to the China Africa Research Initiative of Johns Hopkins University, which accessed official data. It marks the first time since 2012 that the US had regained the lead.\n\nThis American investment is being led by a government agency called the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC). This was set up in 2019 during President Trump's first term of office, and it is not shy about saying that its mission is to take on Beijing. The DFC says on its website that it was established as a means of \"countering China's presence in strategic regions\". What does this investment mean for African firms and countries who are beneficiaries? Last year Rwandan mining company Trinity Metals secured a $3.9m grant from the DFC to help develop the three mines that it owns in the country, producing tin, tantalum and tungsten. \"The US government has been very supportive of what we've been doing, to look at bringing that supply chain directly to the United States,\" says company chairman Shawn McCormick. Trinity now sends tungsten from Rwanda to a processing plant in Pennsylvania. It has also struck a deal to send Rwandan tin to a smelter in Pennsylvania. Mr McCormick denies that the funding from Washington influenced the company's decision to send supplies to the US. \"This was not the US government who said to the CEO and I 'could you please get that tungsten to America?' It's our decision as players in the commercial market.\" Trinity is 5% owned by the Rwandan government, and Irish critical minerals investment firm TechMet is also a shareholder. Mr McCormick adds that while some mining operations in Africa can use untrained workers operating in dangerous conditions, Trinity follows the highest standards. \"We have shown that there is a way to produce these materials in a conflict free, child labour free way that is professionalised, and that's paying taxes and respecting the community and the environment, creating jobs and opportunity\".\n\nAFP via Getty Images The African continent is home to vast mineral wealth\n\nSepo Haihambo is an economist, and former executive at banking group FNB Namibia. She says African nations must be assertive in standing up for their national interests when negotiating with US entities, and shouldn't expect any favours. \"To expect [the Americans] to show up and negotiate and propose clauses that are in Africa's best interests on Africa's behalf would be unrealistic,\" she says. \"So Africa really needs to prepare itself for these engagements and be really clear on what [outcomes] it wants.\" Ms Haihambo adds that African governments should expand away from simple cash for minerals deals. \"There's an opportunity to look at different frameworks instead,\" she says. \"You could look at production sharing agreements, joint venture models, local equity participation. Ultimately that then creates an opportunity for African countries to create, maybe, sovereign wealth funds that can then invest into developmental areas like education, healthcare etc.\" She also wants to see more processing of minerals and metals done in Africa, rather than simply exporting the ores overseas, as this would be more financially lucrative.\n\nSepo Haihambo Economist Sepo Haihambo says that African nations must be careful to secure good deals with the US",

    "text": "'Heathrow should be expanded without moving M25'\n\n15 hours ago Share Save Share Save\n\nReuters British Airways is Heathrow Airport's biggest operator\n\nHeathrow Airport should be expanded without moving the M25 motorway, the CEO of British Airways Sean Doyle has said. The government is considering two proposals to expand Heathrow - one from the airport itself and another from the Arora Group, led by hotel tycoon Surinder Arora. The airport's owners want to build a full-length 3,500m (2.2-mile) runway, which would involve diverting the M25, while Arora Group is seeking permission for a 2,800m runway, negating the need to move the motorway. A decision on which developer will build Heathrow's third runway is due by the end of the month.\n\nIn the summer, Heathrow Airport revealed its £49bn plans to build a third runway and accompanying infrastructure, including a new road tunnel under the airport, and widening the M25 motorway between junctions 14 and 15. Arora Group's bid includes proposals for a shorter runway, with no need to alter the M25, with a lower price tag of £25bn. But additional infrastructure would be needed.\n\nThe Arora Group's \"Heathrow West\" proposal would not require the M25 to be diverted, whereas Heathrow's \"North-Western Runway\" plan would\n\nSpeaking at the Airlines 2025 conference in Westminster on Monday, Mr Doyle said: \"If you can avoid moving the M25, you should avoid moving the M25. \"I can't argue against the logic of that. \"I think we should look at ways of potentially building a shorter runway.\" The proposal from Heathrow's owners would require a new M25 tunnel and bridges to be built 130m to the west of the existing motorway. Traffic would be switched to the new route during overnight closures. The applicants behind both expansion proposals have been asked by the government to provide further details of their plans, relating to the impact for investors, affected communities and businesses.\n\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "text": "Named on a napkin: EasyJet celebrates 30 years\n\n22 hours ago Share Save Louise Parry, in Luton and Fae Southwell Share Save\n\nEasyJet EasyJet made its first flight on 10 November 1995 from Luton to Glasgow\n\nTaking to the skies in its unmistakable white and orange aircraft, EasyJet is celebrating 30 years since its first ever flight from Luton Airport to Glasgow. Since 1995, the budget airline has massively grown its business and brand – in part thanks to the TV documentary Airline. \"Few recent moments in travel have been more important than the explosion of mass travel, brought about by the rise of budget airlines like EasyJet,\" said Cathy Adams, travel news features editor of the Times and Sunday Times. Former EasyJet pilot George Hibberd said although the company has \"done some good by making flying a lot more accessible for the average person, unfortunately that has come at a cost\" to the climate. So what are the airline's big milestones, and where is it heading in the coming decades?\n\neasyGroup Entrepreneur Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou was 28 when he founded EasyJet\n\nSir Stelios Haji-Ioannou founded EasyJet after carrying out research in the USA. \"I learned if you really want to make money in this area, you should start a low cost airline,\" he said. He came up with the name by \"scribbling on a napkin\". \"I tried Stel-Air, CheapJet, Lite Jet, then the word 'Easy' came up and I thought, 'This is it',\" he said. Making Luton Airport its base was \"a risky selection\" that paid off. \"Luton was considered in the middle of nowhere back then - we chose the cheapest of the London airports,\" he said. Sir Stelios recalls the \"cold and wet November morning\" when EasyJet's first flight took off from Luton to Glasgow at 07:00 GMT on 10 November 1995. At the time, the company owned one aircraft and employed 77 people. Now it is the UK's largest airline with 356 aircraft, more than 1200 routes, and employs 19,000 staff – including 3,847 in Luton.\n\n'Easy and simple'\n\nITV Jane Boulton (second from right) was one of the stars of ITV fly-on-the-wall series Airline, which followed EasyJet staff\n\nIts fame grew through stunts such as the time its founder and friends boarded a rival's plane wearing EasyJet orange boiler suits, and the ITV series Airline. \"Letting the cameras in to a small airline - it was a free audience. That put EasyJet into every home in Britain,\" Sir Stelios said. Jane Boulton, one of the stars of Airline, joked that the TV documentary led to the \"misconception that a lot of people missed their flight\". \"But it took a year to film six episodes. \"For the most part, we were having a great time with passengers – not telling people they'd missed their flight.\" She recalled the phone sales lines lighting up after each episode. \"Stelios is a very clever man, he couldn't have had a better marketing strategy,\" she said.\n\nITV Jane joined EasyJet in 1996 as a check-in supervisor and said the team worked \"like a well-oiled machine\"\n\nMs Boulton remembers the heady days of working as EasyJet's check-in supervisor at Luton Airport. \"From the time the aircraft landed and took off again, we only had 20 minutes to get everybody off, people and bags back on, and refuel if necessary. \"Safety was always the priority. The passengers didn't know, but behind the scenes it was a hive of activity.\" She said the brand lived up to its name, as \"everything was easy and simple\". \"We didn't have printed boarding cards, we had plastic ones that we reused. It was much quicker to check in and board people.\" Ms Boulton said many other airlines were more \"prim and proper\", but EasyJet \"made it more casual\". \"We wore denim jeans and bomber jackets. I think they were the first of their kind.\"\n\n'Reshaped travel'\n\nCathy Adams Sunday Times travel editor Cathy Adams said British travellers had to be \"savvier than ever\" in dealing with budget airlines\n\nCathy Adams said the rise of low-cost airlines like EasyJet had \"reshaped our expectations around travel\". \"I grew up in the EasyJet and Ryanair generation, where it was entirely normal to hop on £2.99 return flights to an obscure capital on the continent. \"Before budget carriers arrived, air travel was an elite pursuit for the very few, but now for millions it's possible to travel multiple times a year.\"\n\nMP for Luton South Rachel Hopkins agreed that cheap flights had \"made the opportunity to travel a real possibility for hardworking local people in Luton – when you could get a flight for less than a pair of Levi 501 jeans!\" Hopkins said it was \"a huge moment\" when EasyJet chose Luton as their base. \"They have grown significantly, becoming a key local employer in our town and providing thousands of job and apprenticeship opportunities,\" she added.\n\n'Wrong flight path'\n\nGeorge Hibberd George Hibberd worked for EasyJet for three years but became \"increasingly uncomfortable\" about aviation's impact on the climate\n\nFor all those celebrating, others are concerned that mass aviation has added millions of tonnes of excess carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. George Hibberd, 32, left his job as an EasyJet pilot to co-found Safe Landing, a community of aviation workers concerned about climate change. \"Aviation has connected cultures all around the world, it's a true gift. \"I'm glad it's no longer a privilege to fly, but the majority of emissions are made by a small minority of very frequent fliers. \"The direction the industry is going is on the wrong flight path,\" he said. EasyJet emitted eight million tonnes of greenhouse gases in 2024 – more than the total emissions of Albania or Sierra Leone. It has launched a plan to reach net zero by 2050, admitting its \"operations are negatively contributing to climate change\". However, Mr Hibberd said it relied too heavily on unproven technologies, and that planned passenger growth would cancel out any success. \"They're getting more efficient, but if you plot it against the projected growth overall, [emissions are] going up and up.\" He added that EasyJet's net zero pathway graph was \"quite misleading\". \"That downward line looks like their total emissions, but it's actually the 'emissions intensity' which is per passenger.\" Mr Hibberd believes \"we need to temporarily reduce the amount we fly\", and advocates a frequent flier levy.\n\nEasyJet Captain David Morgan says EasyJet began with a Boeing 737 fleet before switching to Airbus jets\n\nCaptain David Morgan, EasyJet's chief operating officer and one of their pilots, said: \"It's widely known that aviation is one of the most difficult sectors to decarbonise, because of the energy you need to power a commercial aeroplane. \"We're acutely aware of our sustainability responsibilities and have a very clear net zero road map. \"We invest in the most efficient planes that it's possible to buy, and use sustainable aviation fuel in line with mandates.\" He said the airline, which runs almost 2,000 flights per day in the summer, hopes to continue growing. Having opened a new base in Southend in 2025, it will open ones in Newcastle and Marrakech in 2026. \"We're always looking to what's next, what places are popular - such as North Africa and Iceland. Markets are emerging all the time. \"Our mission is to be Europe's most loved airline,\" he said.\n\nRachel Hopkins MP Rachel Hopkins, centre, says she hopes EasyJet will \"continue to thrive in Luton for many years to come\"",

    "text": "How does London's housing crisis affect the UK economy?\n\n22 hours ago Share Save Meghan Owen London work and money correspondent Share Save\n\nShutterstock\n\nLondon is falling far short of its building targets, homelessness has reached record levels and families are being priced out. Yet the financial fallout extends far beyond the capital.\n\nA \"localised housing crisis\" has become a \"national problem\", according to Liam Sides, associate director in Oxford Economics' Cities & Regions team. The capital has been the weakest-growing region since 2008, with Greater Manchester's thriving economy outpacing the rest of the country, a report by the independent economic advisory firm suggests. Despite the fact that ONS figures show London accounts for almost a quarter of the UK economy, the report shows the capital has been in a \"stagnant\" state since the 2008 financial crisis, and cites housing costs and availability as some of the key factors for its stuttering growth. Mr Sides says that \"London is such a substantial part of the UK economy and its underperformance has become a central part of the UK's overall productivity slump\". London's economy relies on a skilled workforce, he says, but high house prices and a housing shortage \"limits the ability of skilled labour to move to highly productive roles\" and mean London is not as attractive for skilled global workers.\n\nHaddy Folivi Self-employed publicist Haddy Folivi left London with her two children in 2021, due to \"ridiculous\" house prices\n\nAuthor of the analysis and Cities & Regions economist at Oxford Economics, Alexander Harvey adds: \"High housing costs, fuelled by limited land availability and regulatory constraints are... pushing workers further away from their place of work.\" This limits the benefits that come from firms and workers being located close to each other, he adds.\n\nSelf-employed publicist Haddy Folivi, 48, moved from London to Peterborough in 2021 with her two children. Born and raised in Hackney, she said house prices in the capital had become \"ridiculous\", and the main driver for her to leave. \"For a house with a room each for my kids, we were looking at around £500,000. \"I didn't want to overstretch myself and pay thousands of pounds a month on a mortgage. I wanted to get something affordable for us as a family.\" She says many families in London, including many of her friends, are being \"forced out\". Ms Folivi is part of a \"mass exodus\" of people being priced out of London, according to Paul Rickard, CEO of affordable housing provider Pocket Living. According to its poll of 1,000 people aged 25-45 in Greater London: 42% said although they didn't want to move out of London, they may have no choice\n\nAlmost two-thirds of young people rely on some form of borrowing to cover their housing payments. Mr Rickard says in the five years they have been running the survey, \"these are some of the most concerning findings we have seen\". \"London's housing crisis has deepened into something more corrosive: an affordability breakdown that is reshaping how a generation lives, works and plans for the future.\"\n\nUK businesses are increasingly pivoting their hiring to regional offices and away from the capital, with the proportion of head office-related jobs outside London at record levels, affording to Vacancysoft, which provides labour market data and analysis. For instance, 58% of head office jobs within financial services are now based outside London. Vacancysoft's CEO James Chaplin says \"companies are reorganising their workflows across multiple sites, where, increasingly, the proportion of people hired into London is being reduced\". He hails Manchester as \"hugely successful in positioning itself as an alternative hub for financial services middle and back office\". \"Looking ahead, either the cost of living in London needs to come down, where rents or the costs of mortgages are the biggest issue, or businesses need to increase the packages they are offering.\"\n\nPA Media Manchester has outperformed many other parts of the UK in recent years\n\nHousebuilding itself contributes to the economy through jobs, investment, more labour mobility, and in March the Office for Budget Responsibility forecast that the creation of an additional 170,000 new homes, as planned in the government's reforms, would boost GDP by 0.2% by 2029-30. But this estimate could be influenced by factors including capacity constraints in the housebuilding sector.\n\nA report by Public First, a policy and research consultancy, found boosting London's homebuilding could contribute £40bn to the UK economy by 2034. According to its analysis, meeting London's target of building 88,000 new homes a year would boost productivity in the capital by 5.6% in the long term and raise the average Londoner's take-home pay by £3,700. But recent figures show London's housebuilding has been grinding to a halt, leading to a reduction in the affordable housing quota. The Home Builders Federation reported that only 30,000 residential properties were built in London in the year to June.\n\nWhat's the solution?\n\nLondon's housing crisis is \"not just a social issue but an economic imperative\", says Simon Carter, CEO of property company British Land. He calls for \"unlocking a step change in housebuilding\" in order to benefit London and the UK economy. But Pocket Living's Mr Rickard thinks the focus should be on first-time buyer support. \"It's no good just building homes - people need to be able to buy as well. At the moment, both parts of the equation are not there. \"The policy announcements in the last year - government has pulled some levers but we need to pull thousands more.\"\n\nA government spokesperson said: \"We will leave no stone unturned to build the 1.5 million homes this country desperately needs so we can drive growth and restore the dream of homeownership.\" The overhaul of the planning system \"will add £6.8bn to the UK economy according to the OBR (Office for Budget Responsibility) forecast\", the spokesperson said, adding that \"we have recently introduced emergency measures to ramp up housebuilding in London and unblock growth\". A spokesperson for the Mayor of London, Sir Sadiq Khan, said: \"Continuing to grow London's economy is one of the mayor's top priorities, upskilling Londoners and unlocking at least 150,000 high quality jobs through his Inclusive Talent Strategy and backing businesses and innovation through his London Growth Plan.\" \"Sadiq is also focused on tackling the housing crisis, and is doing everything in his power to deliver more homes of all tenures. \"",

    "text": "Honesty boxes should be dying like cash. But many are flourishing\n\n2 days ago Share Save Kevin Peachey Cost of living correspondent Share Save\n\nBBC Annabelle says some customers travel for miles to buy her cookies from her honesty box\n\nHonesty boxes: traditionally found on rural lay-bys, offering local produce like eggs and apples in exchange for a small donation. With cash use falling, they might be expected to disappear - a roadside relic as we all pull onto the technology superhighway. But, in fact, many are flourishing. Cash payments are being replaced with online transfers via QR codes, and small traders are using honesty boxes as part of their marketing on social media. That online marketing has a payoff. Some are finding that instead of just attracting passing trade, customers are making a special journey to buy from them.\n\n'Part of my community'\n\nOn the side of an A-road between Canterbury and the north Kent coast is a small but colourful honesty box. Packed inside the Blean Bakery Box are cookies for £3.50 in an assortment of unusual flavours, and tubs of dunkable cookies with dips from candyfloss to brownie - all baked by Annabelle Cox.\n\nThe 36-year-old founded Dunk Cookies just before the pandemic. She installed the honesty box earlier this year and it has brought in enough money to pay the rent at her bakery on a nearby industrial estate. \"The honesty box means we can be part of my community - bringing something to them, rather than the business being solely online,\" says the affable Annabelle. Various food festivals gave her a following and some local custom. Now, she opens the honesty box every day at 9am until locking it back up at 8pm. Despite plans to scale back the bakery next year, to spend more time with her young son, the honesty box will remain. It is on a school run route, can empty within hours, and is regularly refilled. Annabelle films the re-stock and posts it on Instagram. The coverage has brought in customers from further afield. Annabelle also posts pictures of her adding up the takings, to test the honesty or dishonesty of customers. Almost without exception, they pay. One customer who arrived during the BBC's visit filled a bag, scanned the QR code, and promised to transfer the money once she had a signal. There was no doubt she would. Annabelle says 90% of customers pay online after scanning the QR code inside the box. Many other honesty boxes around the UK use the same technology, some even leaving a calculator inside for customers to tot up the cost of what they take. Anyone who is confused can press the video doorbell, for a hotline to Annabelle's bakery a few miles away. That also helps with security, as does the fact the box is placed outside the window of the local pub - The Hare at Blean.\n\nMatthew says he's keen to support a fellow local, small business\n\nMatthew Hayden, the chef-owner of the pub, says he is happy to support another local business, and lends the space for the box free of charge. Occasionally, it brings in custom for him too. Having spent time in Byron Bay in Australia, where he saw honesty boxes at the end of people's driveways, he says he liked the idea of seeing something similar at home. At the box outside the window, and inside at the bar, customers are mostly, and increasingly, using their smartphones to pay.\n\nBoth take cash - the honesty box has envelopes and a letterbox for change. But Matthew says payment for food and drinks in the pub is now \"almost entirely\" by phone. Half of UK adults now pay for things by tapping their phone, according to the latest data from banking trade body, UK Finance. Graham Mott, director of strategy at Link - which oversees cash access and the UK's ATM network - says that has been a rapid change, meaning many shoppers now only go out with a phone and carry coins less. Casual payments, such as charity donations, honesty boxes, crafts stalls and rewarding buskers, are increasingly made digitally. \"There are positives, as traders don't have to rely on customers having available change. They may also have the opportunity to upsell items at higher prices,\" he says. But some charities are worried that the disappearance of cash will shut some people out of all types of retail. Affordable food club charity The Bread-and-Butter Thing says many of its younger members use notes and coins, alongside banking apps, to make their limited budgets stretch further.\n\nSocial following\n\nAs well as phones as a method of paying, people are discovering honesty boxes by scrolling through social media. Some small businesses, like Annabelle's have spotted the opportunity. Bakeries, in particular, seem to have taken to the idea of advertising via honesty boxes - the contents of which are filmed, pictured and posted online. A quick search on social media quickly highlights bright young bakers with bright boxes. But the range of produce in honesty boxes goes far beyond cookies and cakes. Oysters and dog treats are among the more unusual contents for sale at these stalls. In Scotland, where honesty boxes are commonly found, a golf course allowed people to pay for their round by dropping money into a collection box.\n\nKathryn Martin When Kathryn catalogued honesty boxes, payment was in cash\n\nEven so, the traditional honesty box lives on in many areas. Many farms and smallholdings sell eggs, seasonal vegetables and fruit for cash in collection boxes. For the most part, this is still the image conjured up when people talk of honesty boxes they have used. These images were literally the source of a collection by photographer Kathryn Martin, who spent a couple of years charting these quirky stalls during travels around Suffolk, Essex, Somerset and Sussex. In her notes, she says she loves an honesty box \"not just for the delight of the home grown and the childish excitement and memories of playing shop but the discovery of the simple, unpretentious, local and handmade in a world saturated with high tech, fake news and globalisation\".\n\nKathryn Martin Roadside honesty boxes often contain local produce and eggs as captured by Kathryn\n\nShe also enjoys seeing the stalls themselves, and the ice cream tubs inside them to collect customers' cash. But she says QR codes change the dynamics of an honesty box, and the sense of trust. Perhaps, as with other technology, it brings a loss of innocence. \"On the whole, most people are honest,\" she writes about the traditional honesty box. \"Maybe it's the uncertainty of being watched from behind that twitching curtain or perhaps it's the nostalgic feel-good factor from playing shop, or the untainted natural beauty of their rural locations that remind us that honesty is indeed the best policy.\"",

Normally the benefit runs out after eight weeks living outside the UK, but many people affected complained that HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) had stopped their money after they went on holiday for just a short time. The move came after MPs on the Treasury Select Committee demanded answers from the tax authority. HMRC has apologised for any errors and says anyone who thinks their benefits have been stopped incorrectly should contact them.\n\nA government spokesperson said: \"We're very sorry to those whose payments have been suspended incorrectly. \"We have taken immediate action to update the process, giving customers one month to respond before payments are suspended. We remain committed to protecting taxpayers' money and are confident that the majority of suspensions are accurate.\" In September, the government began a crackdown on child benefit fraud which it believes could save £350m over five years. The new system allows HMRC records to be compared with Home Office international travel data, and the tax authority had used this data to stop payments to thousands of families. But it is now reviewing all of the cases following a growing number of complaints from people affected who said they had been on holiday, and had returned to the UK after a short time. Eve Craven went on a five-day break with her son to New York. She told the BBC's Money Box programme that about 18 months after the trip she received a letter saying the child benefit for her son had been stopped. The letter cited her trip to the US, saying it had no record of her return. \"It gave me a month basically to give them all the requested information to prove that I'd come back to the UK,\" she said. \"It's just a very big ask for something that they've messed up on, and they should have been able to sort out themselves.\" Eve's child benefit has now been reinstated with missing payments backdated.",

Former Labour Health Secretary Alan Milburn will lead the inquiry into \"Neets\" - the acronym for young people who are not in education, employment or training. According to Work and Pensions Secretary Pat McFadden, the persistently high number of 16-24 year olds falling out of education or work is a \"crisis of opportunity\" requiring urgent action. It is not a new problem but the number of young people who are Neet - now one in eight - has been rising in recent years and is approaching one million.\n\nA quarter cite long-term sickness or disability as a barrier and the number claiming health and disability benefits is rising too. The government says Alan Milburn's review will dig into the reasons behind the rise and examine ways of cutting the long-term costs of youth inactivity and getting young people off benefits and into work. Its conclusions will be published next summer. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has called the broader benefits system unsustainable and unfair but so far selling welfare reform to Labour backbenchers has proved a political minefield for Number 10.",

    "text": "More than 1,400 flights cancelled as US air traffic cuts enter second day\n\n2 days ago Share Save Grace Eliza Goodwin Share Save\n\nGetty Images Travellers wait in a long line at a security checkpoint at Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport on 6 November\n\nMore than 1,400 flights to, from, or within the US were cancelled on Saturday after airlines were told this week to cut traffic during the federal government shutdown. Nearly 6,000 flights were also delayed, down from over 7,000 delays on Friday, according to flight tracker FlightAware. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced earlier in the week that it would be reducing air travel capacity by up to10% at 40 of the nation's busiest airports as air traffic controllers, who are working without pay during the shutdown, report fatigue. Republicans and Democrats remain divided over how to end the impasse in Congress. Saturday marked the 39th day of the longest shutdown in history.\n\nSenators are in Washington over the weekend for bipartisan negotitations aimed at resolving the deadlock. Republicans have rejected an offer by Democrats to pass the current funding bill, in exchange for a one-year extension to health care subsidies. The shutdown is beginning to be felt by more and more Americans amid cuts to food aid payments and the flight disruptions. In a statement on Saturday, American Airlines urged party leaders \"to reach an immediate resolution to end the shutdown\". New Jersey's Newark Liberty International Airport was experiencing some of the longest wait times. As of Saturday afternoon, arrivals to the airport were delayed by an average of more than four hours, while departures from the airport were delayed by an average of 90 minutes, according to the FAA. The airports with the most cancelled flights on Saturday, both to and from the location, were Charlotte/Douglas International, Newark Liberty International, and Chicago O'Hare International, according to FlightAware.\n\nFlights to John F Kennedy and LaGuardia airports in New York were delayed by nearly three hours and an hour respectively, the FAA reported on Saturday afternoon. Other airports affected by lengthy delays inncluded Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International. With the Thanksgiving holiday approaching on 27 November, it's one of the busiest travel seasons of the year in the US. It's not just commercial flights that have been affected. Restrictions on private jets are also in place, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a Saturday post on X. \"We've reduced their volume at high traffic airports - instead having private jets utilise smaller airports or airfields so busy controllers can focus on commercial aviation,\" Duffy wrote. \"That's only fair.\" And things are likely to get worse in the coming days as the FAA cancels more flights. On Thursday, the agency announced that the flight reductions would be gradual, starting at 4% of flights on Friday before rising to 6% by 11 November, 8% by 13 November, and the full 10% by 14 November. The FAA said the cuts were necessary to maintain safety as air traffic controllers have been overworked during the shutdown. As essential workers, the controllers are required to continue working without pay, and as a result, many have called in sick or taken on second jobs to afford necessities, unions say.\n\nWatch: \"Devastating\" - Airline travellers react to flight reductions",

    "text": "Tesla plans to pay Musk $1tn - do they really need him that much?\n\n3 days ago Share Save Lucy Hooker Business reporter Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nA great leader is a huge asset for a company, of course, but can anyone be worth $1 trillion? That is the pay packet Tesla shareholders have approved for Elon Musk, as long as he meets the targets they have set over the next 10 years. In the meantime he won't collect a salary, but will presumably throw himself into his work with renewed vigour. He was certainly buzzing with energy as he jigged around the stage at the carmaker's Texas headquarters to rapturous applause, telling the audience that while other shareholder meetings were \"snoozefests\", Tesla's are \"bangers\".\n\nMusk has attracted an army of critics, upset that he sided with US President Donald Trump, wielding his chainsaw at government programmes, and wading into politics overseas with explicit support for the far right. But he has an equally large following of admirers, people who believe in his vision and don't doubt that he can achieve it. It seems most of his shareholders are in this camp, after they backed his new remuneration package this week.\n\nOf course shareholders signed up, says New York-based financial analyst Dan Ives. If Musk succeeds - and Ives thinks he will - he will have created trillions of dollars worth of shareholder value, ample payback for investors. Ives sees Musk as a \"modern day Albert Einstein, a Thomas Edison\". Without the stupendous pay package, he says, there was a risk that within a few years Musk would have walked away, taking his Artificial Intellgience (AI) initiatives with him. \"Tesla without Musk is like pizza without cheese,\" he says. Ives does not own shares in Tesla, but analyses the company for his firm Wedbush Securities and thinks Musk's \"ability to go where others are not\" means he may well achieve the targets that have been set. \"There's edgy behaviour, there's haters, but a lot of people love that. And that's why he's the richest person in the world. \"Does it help sell cars in Europe? No. But does it help Tesla win the AI race? Yes.\"\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images\n\nMusk's political activities have prompted a backlash from some customers, including demonstrations outside showrooms earlier this year. But Matt Britzman at Hargreaves Lansdown in London, who has invested in Tesla, says the impact is a drop in the ocean when it comes to Tesla's earnings. Far from weighing on the firm's valuation, he reckons around a third of the value of Tesla can be attributed to what he calls the \"Musk premium\", value that wouldn't be there without him. \"It's a $1.4 trillion company, not based on the current car business. It's a $1.4 trillion business based on expectations of what it can deliver over the next three years.\" And a lot of those expectations are fixed on Musk and his record of thinking big and thinking long term, he says.\n\nThe potential reward for Musk is as astronomical as his vision for space travel. With $1 trillion you could buy 20 million Model Y Teslas, at around $50,000 each. Or you could buy yourself a $10m house every day for 250 years, and still have change for furnishing and decorating. The conditions appear to be very testing, including delivering 20 million Tesla vehicles and one million robots. A million self-driving Robotaxi vehicles will also need to be on the roads. Tesla's overall market value will need to rise from its current $1.4tn to $8.5tn. These are \"incredibly high milestones\", says Ann Lipton, a law professor at the University of Colorado. However, the board does have \"discretion\" to decide when some of them have been met, she adds. \"If intervening events prevent him from reaching the goals, the board can deem them met anyway.\" So the targets may not turn out to be quite as demanding as they appear. There is also nothing in the terms, no constraint, that prevents Musk continuing to speak out about politics or anything else. \"Even after the pay package was proposed, he didn't pull back from his political commentary,\" adds Prof Lipton. \"So it seems to me that this pay package, whatever the goals are, however lofty they may be, they're not going to inhibit him from involving himself in whatever matters he wants to be involved in.\"",

While they feature the usual sprinkle of festive cheer, experts say this year’s ads have also been tapping into some of 2025’s biggest themes, from the cost of living to masculinity. The idea of hardworking families trying to get by is at the centre of Asda’s advert, which depicts the Grinch trying to do his Christmas shopping. Meanwhile, John Lewis’s festive advert explores masculinity and emotion, leading some analysts to suggest it has undertones of one the year's biggest TV shows, Netflix drama Adolescence. “What's striking this year is how the Christmas adverts are letting real life in,” said retail expert Kate Hardcastle. TV historian Dr Richard Wallace adds that if retailers can find a way to “incorporate a topical social issue in a careful way”, it can lead to an advert “really cutting through”. The BBC has looked at the Christmas adverts that are out so far - and asked experts what they tell us about the past year.\n\nJohn Lewis ‘responds to the crisis of masculinity’\n\nThe John Lewis Christmas advert - seen by many as marking the start of the festive season - was beamed into our homes on Tuesday. Set to Alison Limerick's 1990s track Where Love Lives, reimagined by British artist Labrinth, it's the first time the retailer has centred an ad around a father-son relationship. The ad depicts a teenage boy, who struggles to express his emotions for his dad, using music as a way to connect with him. We see the dad discovering an unopened Christmas present with his name on it - a vinyl record of Where Love Lives - which he immediately puts on. As the song fills the room, he's transported back to a 90s club, dancing with his friends, before seeing flashbacks of his son as a baby.\n\nJohn Lewis Family and memories feature heavily in this year's John Lewis advert\n\nWhen we return to the present day, the teenage son and dad share a slightly embarrassed hug and laugh together. Reacting to the ad, retail expert Catherine Shuttleworth said it has \"Adolescence written all over it\". \"Especially with its focus on the lack of communication between father and son,\" she told BBC News. Dr Wallace agreed, saying the advert had given a classic Christmas message of togetherness \"a 2025 twist\". \"There is clearly a desire to incorporate topical issues into this year's adverts,\" he said. \"John Lewis has responded to the crisis of masculinity, so evocatively addressed in one of this year's standout TV dramas Adolescence, to make a touching piece that speaks to the challenges of navigating inter-generational male relationships.\" John Lewis's director of brand Rosie Hanley told BBC News that the script had been planned in January, before Adolescence came out. But the drama's huge success \"gave us reassurance that we were telling a story that was really relevant in 2025,\" she said.\n\n'An affordable Christmas'\n\nAsda Asda has enlisted The Grinch for its festive campaign\n\nOther retailers appear to have nodded to the cost of living. The Asda advert, set to the song Let it Snow, follows The Grinch reluctantly doing his festive shop. But the green cynic changes his tune once he's wowed by some of the low price products on offer. For Dr Wallace, the ad sends a message that \"an affordable Christmas\" is possible, by \"placating the cash-strapped 'Grinch' that threatens to spoil everyone's Christmas\". This message is echoed in Lidl's Christmas advert, which focuses on generosity and small acts of kindness rather than abundance and excess. The ad also has a real-world action point, by pointing viewers towards Lidl's Toy Bank scheme. According to Lidl, the nationwide scheme has seen over 250,000 gifts donated since launch.\n\nM&S Dawn French and her fairy character are back for M&S's Christmas advert\n\nThe theme of community and affordable, practical cheer, is also present in the M&S food advert. The ad sees the return of Dawn French as a festive fairy, and she also appears as herself. We see the actress and comedian stuck in gridlocked traffic, but with a wave of the fairy's wand, a delivery truck is converted into a Christmas party. The festive snacks served at the party are modest and a far cry from the tables of food that we've seen in past adverts. But not all of the retailers have toned it down this year. Beauty retailer Sephora's advert stars none other than Mariah Carey as an angel. She later transforms into a Santa Claus bodysuit, and takes off in a sleigh filled with bags of shiny gifts. Experts say that as a whole, this year's adverts are reflecting the fact many shoppers will be worrying about costs this Christmas. “Value framing is part of the campaign this year,” said Shuttleworth. “And of course that’s relevant this Christmas.” \"We're seeing themes that reflect the world as we actually live it,\" agrees Hardcastle. \"Audiences don't want fantasy; they want recognition. It's proof that even at Christmas, the stories that move us most are the ones that see us.\"\n\nSainsbury's Sainsbury's Christmas advert brings back the BFG\n\nElsewhere, a number of retailers have gone for fictional characters. Again, this is being seen as a deliberate move given the economic backdrop. \"If you're struggling and someone's showing you a glossy life on screen, it's not going to make you feel particularly great,\" Hardcastle said. In the Aldi advert, its mascot Kevin the Carrot is back. This time, he is set to pull our heart strings as he pops the question to his beloved Katie the Carrot. Not to be outdone, Sainsbury's advert also features a famous animated character - Roald Dahl's beloved Big Friendly Giant. And Argos has also gone for the same characters as last year - cartoon duo Connie the doll and Trevor the dinosaur - who are joined this year by Inbetweeners star Simon Bird.\n\n'The mood of the nation'\n\nAldi Kevin the Carrot is back in Aldi's Christmas advert",

    "text": "Trump calls for probe of meat packers over beef prices\n\n3 days ago Share Save Danielle Kaye Business reporter Share Save\n\nEPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock\n\nUS President Donald Trump on Friday asked the Justice Department to investigate meat-packing companies over their possible role in driving up beef prices. Trump, on social media, accused the industry of contributing to the high cost of beef for US consumers \"through Illicit Collusion, Price Fixing, and Price Manipulation\". His call for a probe focused on potential antitrust violations comes as soaring beef prices have become a political problem, threatening to undercut his promises to bring down food costs in the US. The announcement also follows Republican losses in key elections this week, where voters' concerns about the cost of living and Trump's handling of the economy boosted Democrats.\n\nTrump has put beef prices at the centre of his messaging about the cost of living - and food inflation, specifically. But his other recent proposals to lower prices sparked backlash among ranchers. Last month, on social media, he urged US ranchers to lower prices for their cattle. Then, he drew their ire when he proposed importing more beef from Argentina, potentially quadrupling US purchases. At the time, ranchers worried that some of his solutions would make it harder for them to make a living, while not helping much at the grocery store. As Trump keeps pushing to lower beef prices for American consumers, his latest call for federal investigation signals a possible shift in focus, toward the meat-packing industry, which slaughters livestock and then processes and packages their meat. \"We will always protect our American Ranchers, and they are being blamed for what is being done by Majority Foreign Owned Meat Packers, who artificially inflate prices, and jeopardize the security of our Nation's food supply,\" Trump wrote in a social media post. Retail prices for beef mince rose 12.9% in the 12 months to September, and beef steaks were up 16.6%, according to government data published in October. A pound of ground chuck - richer mince from the neck and shoulder of cows - now costs an average of $6.33 (£4.75), compared to $5.58 a year ago. The increases significantly outpaced general food inflation, which stood at 3.1%.",

    "text": "Blame game over Air India crash goes on\n\n3 days ago Share Save Theo Leggett International business correspondent Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nNearly five months after a plane crash in India which killed 260 people, the investigation has become mired in controversy – with the country's Supreme Court the latest to weigh in. Flight 171 was en route to London from Ahmedabad in western India on 12 June. It crashed into a building just 32 seconds after taking off. An interim report was released in July, but critics argue it unfairly focused on the actions of the pilots, diverting attention away from a possible fault with the aircraft. On Friday, a judge in India's Supreme Court insisted that nobody could blame the aircraft's captain. His comments came a week after the airline's boss insisted there was no problem with the aircraft.\n\nDuring a panel discussion at the Aviation India 2025 summit in New Delhi in late October, Air India's chief executive Campbell Wilson admitted that the accident had been \"absolutely devastating for the people involved, for the families of those involved, and the staff\". But he stressed that initial investigations by Indian officials, summed up in a preliminary report, had \"indicated that there was nothing wrong with the aircraft, the engines or the operation of the airline\". He added although Air India was working with investigators it was not involved directly.\n\nBecause the accident happened in India, the investigation is being led by the country's Air Accident investigation Bureau (AAIB). However, because the aircraft and its engines were designed and built in America, US officials are also taking part. A month after the accident, the AAIB published a preliminary report. This is standard procedure in major accident investigations and is meant to provide a summary of the known facts at the time of publication. The report will typically draw on information gleaned from examination of the crash site, for example, as well as basic material downloaded from the flight data recorder. It will not normally make firm conclusions about the cause of the accident. However, the 15-page report into Air India 171 has proved controversial. This is largely due to the contents of two short paragraphs. First, it notes that seconds after takeoff, the fuel cutoff switches - normally used when starting the engines before a flight and shutting them down afterwards – had been moved from the \"run\" to the cutoff position. This would have deprived the engines of fuel, causing them to lose thrust rapidly. The switches were moved back to restart the engines, but too late to prevent the disaster. It then says: \"In the cockpit voice recording, one of the pilots is heard asking the other why did he cutoff. The other pilot responded that he did not do so.\"\n\nWhat the fuel switches would have looked like inside a Boeing 787 Dreamliner cockpit\n\nThat indirectly reported exchange sparked intense speculation about the role of the two pilots, Captain Sumeet Sabharwal and his first officer Clive Kunder, who was flying the plane at the time. A former chair of the National Transportation Safety Board, Robert Sumwalt, claimed the report showed \"this was not a problem with the airplane or the engines\". \"Did somebody deliberately shut down the fuel, or was it somehow or another a slip that they inadvertently shut off the fuel?\" he said during an interview with the US network CBS. Indian aviation safety consultant Capt. Mohan Ranganathan strongly implied that pilot suicide could have caused the accident, in an interview with the country's NDTV channel. \"I don't want to use the word. I've heard the pilot had some medical history and... it can happen,\" he said. Mike Andrews, a lawyer acting on behalf of victims' families, thinks the way in which information has been released has \"led people unfairly and inappropriately to blame those pilots without all the information\". \"An aircraft like this - that is so complex - has so many things that could go wrong,\" he explains. \"To seize upon those two very small, decontextualised pieces of information, and automatically blame pilots for suicide and mass murder... is unfair and wrong.\" What we know so far about Air India crash investigation\n\nThat view is echoed by Capt. Amit Singh, founder of the Safety Matters Foundation, an organisation based in India that works to promote a safety culture in aviation. He has produced a report which claims the available evidence \"strongly supports the theory of an electrical disturbance as the primary cause of the engine shutdown\" that led to the disaster. He believes an electrical fault may have caused the Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC), a computerised system which manages the engines, to trigger a shutdown by cutting off the fuel supply. Meanwhile the flight data recorder, he suggests, may have registered the command to shut off the fuel supply, rather than any physical movement of the cutoff switches in the cockpit. In other words, the switches themselves may not have been touched at all, until the pilots tried to restart the engines. Capt. Singh has also challenged the way in which the investigation has been carried out in India's Supreme Court. He told the BBC the way in which the preliminary report was framed was biased because it \"appears to suggest pilot error, without disclosing all the technical anomalies that occurred during the flight\". Meanwhile the Supreme Court itself has already commented on the issue. It has been considering a petition filed by Pushkarraj Sabharwal, the father of Capt. Sumeet Sabharwal. The 91-year-old has been seeking an independent judicial inquiry into the tragedy. \"It's extremely unfortunate, this crash, but you should not carry this burden that your son is being blamed. Nobody can blame him for anything,\" Justice Surya Kant told him. A further hearing is expected on 10 November.\n\n'Flat out wrong'\n\nThe theory that an electrical fault could have caused the accident is supported by the US-based Foundation for Aviation Safety (FAS). Its founder is Ed Pierson, a former senior manager at Boeing, who has previously been highly critical of safety standards at the US aerospace giant. He believes the preliminary report was \"woefully inadequate... embarrassingly inadequate\". His organisation has spent time examining reports of electrical issues on board 787s. They include water leaks into wiring bays, which have previously been noted by the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Authority. Concerns have also been voiced in some other quarters. \"There were so many of what we consider electrical oddities on that plane, that for them to come out and to all intents and purposes direct the blame to the pilots without exhaustively going through and examining potential system failures, we just thought was flat out wrong,\" he says. He believes there was a deliberate attempt to divert attention away from the plane and on to the pilots. The FAS has called for wholesale reform of current international air accident investigation procedures, citing \"outdated protocols, conflicts of interest and systemic failures that endanger public trust and delay life-saving safety improvements\".\n\n'Keeping an open mind'",

    "text": "Shoppers are turning to Shein - but some still can't leave Primark\n\n3 days ago Share Save Grace Dean Share Save\n\nBBC Martha says she'd rather spend more money on better-quality products\n\nPrimark has long been a staple of UK high streets, luring in shoppers with low-priced clothes, accessories and homeware. But in its UK and Ireland stores, like-for-like sales - a key metric in the retail industry - were down 3.1% in the year to September, which it attributed to a \"weak\" consumer environment and fewer people buying winter clothes during last year's mild autumn. As online stores like Shein and Vinted continue to attract young shoppers, does Primark face a fight to remain relevant - or is it just fine?\n\n\"While the UK clothing market is seeing subdued growth, Primark has significantly underperformed the overall market,\" says Tamara Sender-Ceron, an associate director at market-research agency Mintel, adding that it faces \"increased competition\". Some shoppers point out that online marketplaces like Shein and Temu have even lower prices, a huge range of products, and - crucially - home delivery, something Primark lacks. At Primark's biggest London store on Oxford Street, which BBC News visited this week, Serena Milius has just popped in with her 12-year-old daughter to look at pyjamas, socks and the new Stranger Things range. Serena used to do most of her shopping at Primark - until Shein took over. \"Shein's our main thing,\" the 34-year-old finance manager from Tooting, south-west London, says. She says her wardrobe is now 90% Shein, and goes to Primark for \"little bits and bobs\" like flipflops, candles, socks and cosmetics dupes.\n\nSerena Milius Serena says she's a Shein convert\n\nOthers tell the BBC they'd rather splash out on better-quality products. This includes Martha, a 23-year-old student in Leeds, who only shops at Primark for basics like T-shirts, socks, underwear and cotton buds. For other items, she turns to Weekday, Zara and independent shops. \"I like to buy more expensive items that I'm going to wear over the years,\" she tells the BBC as she browses clothes in a Primark store with her mum. Primark repeatedly faces criticism for its \"fast fashion\" approach with shoppers saying products they buy from there aren't hard-wearing. \"It's not always a lasting item,\" Martha adds. However Primark's product longevity lead, Vicki Swain, said that they have developed a Durability Framework that would help people get more wear from their purchases - no matter how much they can afford to spend. \"We've been investing in making our clothes more durable and also making them with more sustainable materials,\" she told BBC Radio 4's You and Yours programme. The store was busy when the BBC visited on a late Wednesday afternoon, with mainly female shoppers browsing alone or in pairs. Some said they'd gone out of their way to visit, others popping in after finding themselves in the area. Some say they're deterred by Primark's huge, sprawling stores which can sometimes get very busy. \"I do not enjoy shopping in a Primark,\" says Abbi Lily, a 24-year-old content creator from near Bournemouth. She describes the experience as \"very overwhelming\" and \"overstimulating\" and says it can be \"impossible\" to find things.\n\nAbbi Lily Abbi in a cardigan she got from Primark\n\nShe used to buy most of her clothes from Primark, but feels it isn't as cheap as it used to be. \"They just don't have the bargains as much anymore,\" she says, echoing comments some other shoppers made to the BBC. Though Abbi sometimes shops at Shein, she's trying to become more \"intentional\" with her shopping and buy more second-hand items, including through Vinted and Depop. A Primark spokesperson told BBC News that 85% of its products were £10 or under, and said it \"continually benchmarks\" its prices against competitors. Shein uses AI to identify trends and launch \"thousands of new styles daily\", says Ms Sender-Ceron at Mintel. According to a survey by Mintel in May, 46% of UK women aged 16 to 34 had bought fashion items from Shein in the last 12 months. It has held pop-up shops in London and this week opened its first permanent physical shop in a department store in Paris, with long queues of people waiting to get their hands on cut-price garments. \"You can buy anything from Shein,\" said one shopper waiting in the French capital to visit on its opening day. \"It's such a cool thing for people my age who are struggling in this economy.\"\n\nFiras Abdullah/Anadolu via Getty Images Protesters outside Shein's new store in the French capital earlier this week\n\nBut as shoppers queued to get into the store, protesters screamed \"Shame!\" at them. The critics were calling for a boycott of the brand because of the environmental impact of fast fashion and working conditions in its factories. Just over an hour after the new store opened, the French government also confirmed it was initiating proceedings to suspend Shein's website, after prosecutors said they were investigating the company over childlike sex dolls found on its website. Paris prosecutors are also investigating three other platforms - Temu, AliExpress and Wish. Allegations surrounding the sale of childlike sex dolls on Shein first came to light from France's anti-fraud office. Shein has promised to co-operate fully. In a statement, the retailer said it had already temporarily suspended listings from independent third-party vendors.\n\nShould Primark offer delivery?\n\nWith Shein specialising in delivering clothes to your door, Primark does offer click-and-collect services in its nearly 200 UK stores - but not deliveries. Some high-street retailers have been struggling in the UK, but Primark has largely bucked the trend - it's closing a store in Dartford, Kent, next year, which reports say will be its first store closure in a decade. It also opened dedicated Primark Home stores in Belfast and Manchester. Primark relies on its customers shopping in bulk, Mr Stevenson says. \"You might be going in for one thing, but you end up buying seven things that you hadn't really thought about,\" he says. This doesn't happen as much with online shopping, he says. Would Primark's sales be boosted if it did offer delivery? Mr Stevenson is sceptical, saying \"it doesn't feel like they're losing out by not doing that\", but that it could be an option in future. \"If you wanted to buy a couple of things from Primark for £5 each, are you going to pay 50% of that in delivery charge?\" he asks. \"Because buying £10 of stuff is going to cost me £5 to get it tomorrow.\" Primark's spokesperson said that its online model was a \"deliberate choice to streamline operations and pass the savings directly to customers\".\n\nJason Alden/Bloomberg via Getty Images Primark's total global sales were up 1%",

    "text": "Back from the brink: UK red kites aid Spanish cousins\n\n2 days ago Share Save Katharine Da Costa South of England Share Save\n\nMore than 120 British-born red kite chicks have been released in south-west Spain\n\nA British red kite emerges from an aviary in the remote hills of western Spain and takes flight. At six months old, this is its first taste of freedom. Without a sound, it soars high in the sky above scrubland and within seconds disappears from view into a wooded valley in the distance. It is the latest release in a conservation story that has come full circle. Nearly four decades ago, the birds were extinct in England and Scotland with just a few pairs left in Wales.\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, red kite chicks from Spain and Sweden were released in the Chilterns on the Oxfordshire-Buckinghamshire border. It proved so successful that the species is now thriving across the UK, with estimates of more than 6,000 mating pairs or about 15% of the world's population. Dr Ian Evans, from Natural England, was one of the early pioneers. He said: \"There were a lot of unknowns. The first lot we released, we thought they might just die or they might just move away. \"In 1991, we had our first breeding pairs and that was really an eye-opener because we thought 'well, this can be successful'. \"That was the springboard for establishing other release sites in England and Scotland.\"\n\nIan Evans A red kite chick from the original reintroduction project\n\nBritish-born red kite chicks have now been taken to south west Spain as part of a four-year project to revive the population there from the brink of extinction. The region has fewer than 50 mating pairs due to predators like the eagle owl and human factors such as illegal poisoning and electrocution. In 2022, conservationists were granted special licences from Natural England to collect red kite chicks, mostly from Northamptonshire, and send them over to the Extremadura region of Spain. More than 120 chicks have been collected, with about 30 exported each year.\n\nSimon Dudhill About 30 red kite chicks were collected from forests in England and relocated each year over the four-year project\n\nAbout the red kite It is one of Britain's largest birds of prey, known for its reddish-brown body, long wings, forked tail and distinctive \"mewing\" calls\n\nOnce considered a threat to game birds and domestic animals like cats and dogs, the red kite was hunted close to extinction in the UK and at one point there were just a few breeding pairs in central Wales\n\nRed kites are largely scavengers, feeding on carrion and small prey such as rabbits\n\nThe birds breed exclusively in Europe and are endangered due to illegal persecution through shooting, poisoning and trapping\n\nThe chicks have been relocated to Extremadura in Spain where the red kite population has been nearly wiped out\n\nThe chicks are flown to Madrid and then transported 240 miles (385km) south to a wildlife hospital in Villafranca de los Barros, run by Accion por el Mundo Salvaje (AMUS). When I arrive, the small team, led by ornithologist and project manager Alfonso Godino, are hard at work. Each chick has to be weighed, measured and tagged before being fitted with a GPS backpack which allows experts to track them. The birds look lifeless as they are manoeuvred into position. Mr Godino tells me they play dead when they feel under threat. Asked whether the tagging is painful, he says it is a minor discomfort, like having your ears pierced. Alfonso says the juveniles soon get used to the large tags, which are needed so they can be observed from the ground.\n\nRed kites are tagged and fitted with a GPS backpack to monitor their location\n\nThe birds are then moved to holding aviaries near the Portuguese border for two weeks to acclimatise to their new surroundings. The release site is quiet and remote. There is a strong stench of rotting flesh coming from a sheep's carcass that has been left to entice red kites to feed here. As the gate is removed, I half expect the chicks to rush out but, but apart from a few flutters inside the aviary, nothing happens. It takes several hours, as though they are building up courage, before one by one they leave the safety of the aviary behind and fly off into the wild.\n\n'Bittersweet moment'\n\n\"Now is the exciting moment when they are in the wild, they can learn to search for food, to avoid predators, to interact with other species in the area... thanks to the GPS we are going to closely monitor these birds we have released,\" Alfonso tells me. But this is a nerve-racking time for AMUS field technician Sofia Marrero. \"The mortality for raptors in general is really high during the first years of their life,\" she says. \"So now it's a little bit hard because you already know that some of them may not get to sexual maturity, so it's a bittersweet moment.\" In fact, only about a quarter of the red kites released during the project have survived. The biggest threat is from predators and natural causes. In 2023, eagle owls were responsible for killing half of the project's newly released red kite chicks. In response, the team at AMUS adapted how and when the chicks are released to increase their chances of survival.\n\nSebastien Comps, AMUS A tagged red kite takes its first flight into the wild\n\nA lot of work has also been done to adapt thousands of kilometres of power cables to reduce the risk of electrocution. But the biggest human risk to birds of prey is from illegal poisoning. Between 2020-2024, 3,060 red kites were tagged and fitted with GPS as part of the Life EuroKite project, spanning 40 project areas in 12 countries. By September 2024, 1,377 tagged red kites had died - 622 from natural causes, including predation, while 195 died from poisoning and 54 from illegal shooting. Experts say the figures represent just the \"tip of the iceberg\" in terms of illegal persecution. In the UK, the RSPB is working with European partners to provide advice on how to investigate cases of poisoning. A report by the charity last year revealed at least 1,344 birds of prey had been killed in the UK between 2009 and 2023.\n\n\"Raptor persecution is directly linked to game estates so in the lowlands pheasant and partridge and in the uplands grouse,\" Mark Thomas, head of investigations at RSPB says. \"All the statistics prove that... two thirds of all the convictions are for gamekeepers so these are people employed lawfully to control vermin they can control but on some estates some of these gamekeepers kill things that are fully protected,\" he adds. The charity believes licensing game estates would tackle the issue but that is disputed by the Countryside Alliance. In a statement, the non-profit organisation said: \"Any incident of raptor persecution is utterly condemnable, with the penalties already including a prison sentence along with an unlimited fine.\"\n\nAMUS Red kites are scavengers and feed on dead animals and are often the number one victim of poisoning incidents",

    "text": "James Watson: Controversial discoverer of 'the secret of life'\n\n3 days ago Share Save Sam Woodhouse BBC News Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nIn February 1953, two men walked into a pub in Cambridge and announced they had found \"the secret of life\". It was not an idle boast. One was James Watson, an American biologist from the Cavendish laboratory; the other was his British research partner, Francis Crick. Their discovery - of the structure and function of deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA - ranks alongside those of Mendel and Darwin in its significance to modern science. The full Promethean power of their achievement would slowly emerge over decades of research by fellow geneticists. It also opened a Pandora's Box of controversial scientific and ethical issues - including human cloning, designer babies and \"Frankenstein foods\". Demonstrating that DNA has a three-dimensional, double-helix shape allowed Watson and Crick to unlock the secrets of how cells worked; the means by which characteristics were passed down through generations. \"When we saw the answer we had to pinch ourselves,\" said Watson. \"We realised it probably was true because it was so pretty.\" The discovery won them a Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1962 and a permanent place in the historic ranks of great scientific thinkers. It also guaranteed that, if they said something controversial, it made headline news. And Watson - who has died aged 97 - had plenty to say, most notoriously speculating about a link between race and intelligence.\n\nGonville & Caius College At Cambridge, James Watson (right) met Francis Crick, a brilliant scientist with the loudest laugh he had ever encountered\n\nWhen he first suggested that black people are less intelligent, London's Science Museum cancelled a planned lecture - insisting Watson's views went \"beyond the point of acceptable debate\". He suggested \"when you interview fat people, you feel bad, because you know you're not going to hire them\". And he wondered aloud if beauty not only could - but should - be genetically encouraged. Watson was heavily criticised for saying that women should have the right to abort her unborn child if tests proved it would be homosexual. He argued he was simply in favour of choice, that it would be equally permissible to favour homosexual offspring and that it was simply natural to want grandchildren. He alienated many in his own profession, calling many fellow academics \"dinosaurs\", \"deadbeats\", \"fossils\" and \"has-beens\" in his autobiography, Avoid Boring People. In 2014, he became the first living recipient of the Nobel Prize to auction off his medal - in part to help fund future scientific discovery. A Russian tycoon bought it for $4.8m (£3m) and promptly gave it back to him.\n\nJames Dewey Watson was born in Chicago on 6 April 1928 to a family who believed in \"books, birds and the Democratic Party\". He was the only son of Jean and James, who were descendants of English, Scottish and Irish settlers. His political interest came from his mother who worked for the Democrats. The basement of their bungalow would be pressed into service as a polling station at election time. His father's passions were science and bird-watching. Young Watson would accompany his father on birding trips. He learned that science was a discipline demanding careful observation from nature.\n\nGetty Images James Watson studying a model of DNA's double-helix structure\n\nThis left no place for faith. Brought up a Catholic by his mother, Watson described himself as an \"escapee from that religion\". \"The luckiest thing that ever happened to me was that my father did not believe in God,\" he said. The Great Depression of the 1930s saw his father's salary suddenly cut in half and a dash to the bank to get their remaining savings out in time. Watson slept in a tiny attic room shared with his younger sister, Betty. He was a skinny teenager told to go to buy milkshakes to \"fatten him up\". He was socially awkward and expelled from school for poor grades - his work badly affected by a bout of scarlet fever. \"None of my classmates thought I would amount to much,\" he recalled. He did not think of himself as a precocious intellect but he took up a scholarship at the University of Chicago at the tender age of 15. He put it down to \"my mother knowing the dean of admissions\".\n\nIntellectual flowering\n\nUniversity freed him from complicated social hierarchies of school life where popularity and physical stature were critical. It provided the environment where a brilliant but awkward teenager could thrive. Watson thought of majoring in ornithology, the study of birds, but changed to genetics - influenced by Erwin Schrodinger's book What is Life? He described the University of Chicago as an \"idyllic academic institution\" where he was \"instilled with the capacity for critical thought and an ethical compulsion not to suffer fools who impeded his search for truth\". The prevailing scientific wisdom was that genes were proteins able to replicate themselves. The presence of DNA was dismissed as something \"stupid\" simply there to support the protein. Watson became fascinated by the new technique of diffraction whereby X-rays were bounced off atoms to reveal their inner structures. He became convinced that DNA had a structure of its own and was determined to find it. He thought the place to do that was England.\n\nScience Photo Library Watson (left) and Crick won the pair the Nobel Prize for Medicine with their discovery\n\nAt Cambridge, he met Francis Crick, a physicist by training with \"extraordinary conversational ability\" and \"the loudest laugh I have ever known\". They began constructing large-scale models of possible structures for DNA and trying to fit them to the available evidence. In one of the biggest scientific controversies of all time, not all of this evidence was their own. Watson and Crick were in a race with another team at King's College London. Their rivals were Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin. They got on well with him and appallingly badly with her.\n\nRosalind Franklin\n\nWilkins corresponded with the Cambridge pair, sometimes exchanging his thoughts and insights. But Franklin was different. She was the most experienced chemist and an expert in diffraction. She, alongside her student Raymond Gosling, would take photographs of the patterns made by X-rays as they bounced off DNA molecules. Watson and Crick found Franklin \"hostile\" and thought she jealously guarded her research and worked in isolation. They were dismissive and sniped about her appearance, but Watson wasn't above taking a look at her work when Wilkins offered.\n\nGetty Images Rosalind Franklin died of ovarian cancer at 37 and was not awarded a share in the Nobel Prize\n\nThe key evidence was Photo 51. It shows a fuzzy pattern of X-rays that fascinated the Cambridge pair. They threw themselves into a frenzy of model building, testing each theory against the new information. From this, they deduced that DNA must have a three-dimensional, double-helix structure - like a twisted ladder with rungs formed of alternating salt and phosphate groups. Their key conclusions were that, if separated, each strand provided a template for creating the other and that the order of the \"rungs\" was a code. If you can understand that code, they reasoned, you can unpick the wonders of life.\n\nNobel Prize\n\nWilkins wrote to his rivals to congratulate them on winning what had, at times, been a bitter race. When he was awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize for Medicine - alongside Watson and Crick - Franklin did not accompany them. Her life was cut short by ovarian cancer at just 37. According to the rules of the Nobel committee, only the living could be honoured. Her fans felt Franklin had been cheated twice.\n\nGetty Images The 1962 Nobel Prize winners pose with their awards: Professor Maurice Wilkins, Dr. Max Perutz, Prof. Francis Crick, John Steinbeck, Dr. James Watson, and Dr. John Kendrew\n\nLater Watson and his wife, Elizabeth, moved to Harvard. He became professor of biology and had two sons - one of whom suffered from schizophrenia. Then he took over the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York State - an ailing institution which he was credited with turning into one of the world's foremost scientific research institutes. In 1968, his account of the race to discover the structure of DNA, The Double Helix, was published. It is a painful examination of the story. It rakes over the personalities, controversies and bitterness from his point of view. He considered calling the book Honest Jim. But for all Professor Watson's academic achievements, his later career was overshadowed by his controversial public statements.\n\nWatson (right) said Crick had \"extraordinary conversational ability\"\n\nIn 1990, the journal Science wrote that \"to many in the scientific community, Watson has long been something of a wild man, and his colleagues tend to hold their collective breath whenever he veers from the script\". At a conference in 2000, Watson proved it right. He floated the idea that black people might have larger libidos than whites. His lecture argued that melanin, which gives skin its colour, boosted the sex drive. \"That's why you have Latin lovers,\" he told the delegates. \"You never have an English lover, only an English patient.\" He suggested that humanity might screen out the stupid people by genetic testing. Then he gave an interview that put the biggest dent in his reputation. While promoting his autobiography, Watson spoke to the Sunday Times. The piece quoted him as \"gloomy about the prospect of Africa\" because \"our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours - whereas all the testing says not really\". Watson went on to admit this \"hot potato\" was difficult to address and his hope was that everyone was equal. However, he said, \"People who have to deal with black employees find this not true\". He later apologised but his research institute stripped him of executive power and kicked him upstairs as chancellor emeritus.\n\nScience Photo Library Watson wrote many books and articles in the course of a long career, some of which caused controversy and great offence",

    "text": "Bird flu virus spreading in UK could be worst yet, expert warns farmers\n\n5 days ago Share Save Malcolm Prior BBC News rural affairs producer Share Save\n\nPA Media Bird flu outbreaks across UK farms has led to a mandatory housing order being brought in\n\nThe bird flu virus infecting farm flocks across the UK could be the most infectious yet, the government's former top expert in avian virology has warned. The Pirbright Institute's Professor Ian Brown, formerly director of science at the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA), said farmers should be \"prepared for the worst\". With a national mandatory housing order brought into force in England on Thursday, one free-range egg producer in Wiltshire told the BBC she felt \"terrible\" bringing her 32,000 hens inside but an outbreak would be \"disastrous\". The government said the mandatory housing order would \"bring the rates of infection down from the high we are currently experiencing\".\n\nThe Pirbright Institute Professor Ian Brown warned that the virus could mutate so needs to be closely monitored\n\nSo far this season - which began in October - there have been 26 cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 on farms across the UK, with 22 in England alone. Whole flocks have to be culled when an outbreak occurs. Professor Brown told the BBC that the current virus was \"as super-infectious as any high pathogenicity avian influenza we've ever seen\". He added that farmers should now \"prepare for the worst, I'm afraid\". \"We had a very, very serious epidemic between 2021 and 2023 - in excess of 350 outbreaks in the UK. That's off the scale,\" he explained. \"Now, it's really, really difficult to state what the final size of this outbreak would be, but the early signals are not great.\" He added that the threat level meant the poultry industry needed to \"batten the hatches down, review their biosecurity and redouble their efforts\".\n\nSarah Godwin Despite bringing 32,000 free-range hens inside, farmer Sarah Godwin remains \"very nervous\"\n\nSarah Godwin runs a mixed egg, arable and dairy family farm near North Wraxall, in Wiltshire, with her husband and brother-in-law. Her 32,000-laying hens would normally be outdoors for most of the day. They now have to be kept in their barns around the clock. \"It is terrible. We would love to see them out but it is just a necessary evil because the risk of them catching avian influenza is so high and the consequences are so disastrous for a producer, and for the hens as well,\" she explained. But despite bringing the hens inside and putting in place strict biosecurity measures, Mrs Godwin remains \"very nervous\". She said: \"It only takes a tiny, tiny bit of contaminated muck from a wild bird or something that's been brought into the shed on somebody's boots. \"It's literally grammes that can infect the whole flock. And at that point, the whole flock has to be culled.\"\n\nRobust biosecurity",

    "text": "Trump U-turns to renominate billionaire for Nasa chief\n\n6 days ago Share Save Tiffany Wertheimer Share Save\n\nReuters Jared Isaacman is reportedly friends with Elon Musk and has spent millions of dollars on SpaceX missions\n\nDonald Trump has renominated billionaire investor Jared Isaacman to run Nasa, five months after withdrawing his first nomination. The 42-year-old entrepreneur, who has ties to SpaceX founder Elon Musk, had looked set to lead the space agency when Trump abruptly pulled his nomination in late May, following what the president said was a \"thorough review of prior associations.\" While the White House did not specify what those associations were, it was during Trump's high-profile feud with Musk. Isaacman, who is worth an estimated $1.9bn (£1.46bn), is an amateur jet pilot and also became the first non-professional astronaut to walk in space last year, on a mission with SpaceX that he bankrolled.\n\nWhy Trump has suddenly changed his mind is unclear, and the president made no mention of the past when he wrote on his Truth Social platform that he was \"pleased to nominate\" Isaacman for the role. \"Jared's passion for Space, astronaut experience, and dedication to pushing the boundaries of exploration, unlocking the mysteries of the universe, and advancing the new Space economy, make him ideally suited to lead NASA into a bold new Era,\" the president wrote. The Nasa administrator role will be Isaacman's first job in politics, representing a departure from the last two men appointed to the job. It requires confirmation by the Senate, where the Republican Party holds a 53-47 majority. Even though the US government has been shut down since early October, the Senate is still able to confirm presidential nominees. Thanking the president, Isaacman wrote on X that \"it will be an honor\" to serve in the role. \"The support from the space-loving community has been overwhelming,\" he wrote in a long post, that also acknowledged Nasa scientists and innovators. \"I am not sure how I earned the trust of so many, but I will do everything I can to live up to those expectations.\" Sean Duffy, the head of the transport department, has been interim Nasa chief since July.",

    "text": "Stone tool discovery suggests very first humans were inventors\n\n7 days ago Share Save Pallab Ghosh Science Correspondent Share Save\n\nDavid Braun They look like simple stones, but they were state of the art tools millions of years ago, made with great skill and precison\n\nThe very first humans millions of years ago may have been inventors, according to a discovery in northwest Kenya. Researchers have found that the primitive humans who lived 2.75 million years ago at an archaeological site called Namorotukunan used stone tools continuously for 300,000 years. Evidence previously suggested that early human tool use was sporadic: randomly developed and quickly forgotten. The Namorotukunan find is the first to show that the technology was passed down through thousands of generations.\n\nAccording to Prof David Braun, of George Washington University, in Washington DC, who led the research, this find, published in the journal Nature Communications, provides incredibly strong evidence for a radical shake-up in our understanding of human evolution. \"We thought that tool use could have been a flash in the pan and then disappeared. When we see 300,000 years of the same thing, that's just not possible,\" he said. \"This is a long continuity of behaviour. That tool use in (humans and human ancestors) is probably much earlier and more continuous than we thought it was.\"\n\nDavid Braun The stone tools were so sharp that the researchers could cut their fingers on some of them\n\nArchaeologists spent ten years at Namorotukunan uncovering 1,300 sharp flakes, hammerstones, and stone cores, each made by carefully striking rocks gathered from riverbeds. These are made using a technology known as Oldowan and is the first widespread stone tool-making method. The same kinds of tools appear in three distinct layers. The deeper the layer the further back the snapshot in time. Many of the stones were specially chosen for their quality, suggesting that the makers were skilled and knew exactly what they were looking for, according to the senior geoscientist on the research team, Dr Dan Palcu Rolier of the University of São Paulo in Brazil. \"What we see here in the site is an incredible level of sophistication,\" he told BBC News. \"These guys were extremely astute geologists. They knew how to find the best raw materials and these stone tools are exceptional. Basically, we can cut our fingers with some of them.\" Geological evidence suggests that tool use probably helped these people survive dramatic changes in climate. The landscape shifted from lush wetlands to dry, fire-swept grasslands and semideserts,\" said Rahab N. Kinyanjui, senior scientist at the National Museums of Kenya.\n\nThese sharp environmental changes would normally force animal populations to adapt through evolution or move away. But the toolmakers in the region managed to thrive by using technology rather than biological adaptation, according to Dr Palcu Rolier. \"Technology enabled these early inhabitants of East Turkana to survive in a rapidly changing landscape - not by adapting themselves, but adapting their ways of finding food.\" The evidence of stone tools at different layers shows that for a long and continuous period, these primitive people flew in the face of biological evolution, finding a way of controlling the world around them, rather than letting the world control them. And this happened at the very beginning of the emergence of humanity, according to Dr Palcu Rolier. \"Tool use meant that they did not have to evolve by modifying their bodies to adapt to these changes. Instead, they developed the technology they needed to get access to the food: tools for ripping open animal carcasses and digging up plants.\"\n\nDavid Braun The Namorotukunan site, located in Kenya's Turkana Basin, lies close to the ancient course of a long dried up major river which once attracted settlements of early humans and their ancestors\n\nThere is evidence for this at the site: of animal bones being broken, being cut with these stone tools, which means that through these changes, they were consistently able to use meat as a way of sustenance. \"The technology gives these early inhabitants an advantage, says Dr Palcu Rolier. \"They are able to access different types of foods as environments change, their source of sustenance is changing, but because they have this technology, they can bypass these challenges and access new food.\"\n\nDavid Braun Archaeologists excavate a 2.58 million year old site in northern Kenya at the site of Namorotukunan",

    "text": "Firms ordered to reduce forever chemicals in drinking water sources for 6 million people\n\n8 days ago Share Save Esme Stallard, Climate and science reporter, BBC News and Becky Dale and Wesley Stephenson, Senior data journalists, BBC Verify Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nWater companies have been ordered to tackle potentially harmful levels of so-called forever chemicals in drinking water sources for more than six million people, the BBC can reveal. Forever chemicals, or PFAS, are a group of thousands of substances used in everyday products. They are persistent pollutants which build up in the environment, and a small number have been linked to increased risk of some serious illnesses. The BBC examined 23 enforcement notices issued by the Drinking Water Inspectorate over elevated levels of PFAS which could \"constitute a potential danger to human health\" to see how many people were affected. Industry body Water UK said it was confident drinking water was safe.\n\nBut Water UK called for a ban on the chemicals to prevent accumulation. Amid growing worries about these chemicals, water companies have been required since 2021 to test for 47 of the most concerning ones in water supplied to customers' homes and drinking water sources such as aquifers and reservoirs. In the last four years, 1.7 million tests for individual forever chemicals have been carried out across the network. At least 9,432 of those recorded PFAS levels above the level which the DWI says could constitute a potential danger to human health. When a test result is above or likely to breach this level - set at 0.01ug/L - (micrograms per litre) the Drinking Water Inspectorate issues enforcement notices to the water company requiring action to be taken to ensure water is safe. The BBC analysed the enforcement documents, highlighted by Watershed Investigations - a group of environmental journalists - to identify all the water supply areas with sanctions in place. Using publicly available information, we matched each supply system to the number of customers it serves, identifying a minimum of six million people.\n\nForever chemicals have been used prolifically since the 1940s in thousands of products from frying pans to medical equipment to school uniforms. Over time they have found their way into the environment - and the water that gets treated for drinking - through the washing of PFAS products, storm runoff and releases from industrial sites, according to Dr William Hartz, an environmental chemist specialising in PFAS at research institute NILU in Norway. He said this might include PFAS leaching out as rainwater filters through landfill sites or firefighting training sites, where the use of some firefighting foam directly releases forever chemicals into the environment. The study of PFAS is an emerging field but a small number of these chemicals have been identified as carrying significant risks to human health. Earlier this year the World Health Organization raised significant concerns about two specific compounds. It classified PFOA as carcinogenic, and PFOS as possibly carcinogenic - increasing the risk of thyroid, testicular and kidney cancers. Both substances are now banned.\n\nBut Megan Kirton, senior projects officer at environmental charity Fidra, said the chemistry of PFAS meant they do not easily break down, so even if banned they remain in the environment unless treated by water companies. \"It's a very tough situation that we're in, because PFAS is very hard to get out of water. It's like trying to get milk out of your coffee once you've already poured it in there,\" she said. The BBC assessed more than 2,000 individual test results from 2024, obtained via Freedom of Information Act requests, to identify which specific PFAS compounds were being found when levels breached the limits. This showed that both PFOS and PFOA were found in more than 350 of the drinking water tests.\n\nKristen Colwell/Getty Images Some firefighting foam used on chemical fires previously contained the now banned forever chemicals PFOA and PFOS\n\nThe Drinking Water Inspectorate has said that water quality remains safe because, once a sanction is issued, water companies are required to increase testing, change or strengthen treatment for PFAS, or remove a source of drinking water altogether. This process can take several years and requires months of monitoring before a sanction is removed. The inspectorate told the BBC that it \"operates one of the world's most comprehensive PFAS monitoring programmes\", ensuring the public can have \"complete confidence in the safety of their drinking water\". However, environmental charities and the Royal Society of Chemistry have raised concerns that UK guidelines are not legally binding and that the limits, which are 2.5 times higher than those of the US, should be reduced. \"I think we have a pretty good idea of both what PFAS are in the waters in the UK, and knowing that these health effects happen at very low levels, so we think it's time that they put these guidance into law, to make sure water companies are fully held to account,\" said Stephanie Metzger, policy adviser at the Royal Society of Chemistry. In July, an independent review into the England and Wales' water system commissioned by the government found that \"there is a need for stricter treatment requirements to protect public health and the environment\". The BBC understands that the government is currently preparing a white paper in response to the review which will include changes to the Drinking Water Inspectorate. But removing PFAS is very challenging for water companies with conventional water treatment infrastructure, the Environment Agency has said. Prof Peter Jarvis, professor of water science and technology at Cranfield University, said there were technologies such as nanofiltration occasionally deployed by the water industry which could be used more widely, but that these came with high costs and huge energy demands. \"We have got to have a bit of a more mature conversation about how we go about implementing these types of technology, and how we pay for them,\" he said. Water UK told the BBC that: \"Regardless of where you are in the country, when you turn on your tap, you are enjoying the very best drinking water in the world\". But speaking to the Today programme, CEO David Henderson said that in light of the rising treatment costs the chemicals should be banned. \"This £70m we are spending each and every year should be paid for by the chemical companies, it is really unfair for people through their water bills to have this added on top,\" he said. In addition to the comment from Water UK, a spokesperson from South West Water said that the five notices against it were \"precautionary\" and that it was \"investing £42 million over the next five years to upgrade the water supply system.\"\n\nRelated internet links Drinking Water Inspectorate",

    "text": "Bats are seeking sanctuary in churches - but they're making an unholy mess\n\n31 October 2025 Share Save Rebecca Morelle, Science Editor and Alison Francis, Senior Science Journalist Share Save\n\nChris Damant/Bernwood Ecology About half of all churches in England have bats in them\n\nIt's a job that can only be done under the cover of darkness. As night falls, the bat hunters make their way amongst the gravestones of Guestwick Church in Norfolk. The creaking door opens. Inside is the pitch black, deserted church and the team start to set up their specialist gear. Infrared and thermal cameras are carefully positioned, and audio detectors are set to bat friendly frequencies.\n\nThe bats soon begin to emerge, darting and swooping up and down the aisles, the amplified sounds of their bat chatter filling the historic building. \"Many of these churches have been on these sites for probably 1,000 years, and probably as long as they've been standing they've had bats in them,\" says Diana Spencer, from the Bats in Churches Project. A new study published in the British Ecological Society's journal People & Nature has found that these historic buildings are providing vital homes for the nocturnal animals. The research, based on citizen science surveys led by the Bat Conservation Trust, estimates that half of all churches in England - that's more than 8,000 - have bats in them. And that figure rises to about 80% for older churches. \"They're basically like a man-made forest,\" says Spencer. \"Full of little nooks and crannies where they can roost, big open flight spaces, dry spaces inside, away from the rain, where they can fly around. It is really just an absolutely perfect environment.\"\n\nTony Jolliffe/BBC News Special cameras are needed to spot the nocturnal animals\n\nChris Damant/Bernwood Ecology Churches have plenty of spots where the Natterer's bat likes to roost\n\nThere are two types of bats at Guestwick: Common Pipistrelles and Natterer's. They roost high up in the rafters. The Pipistrelles emerge first, flying around for a few minutes, before squeezing out through minute gaps around the church door. The Natterer's come out a little later, preferring to exit through small holes in the roof to get outside and find food. Without the help of the specialist cameras, the bats are near impossible to spot, lost in the darkness. About a third of the churches surveyed in the study had no idea that bats were living there. But in others, their presence was much more noticeable. Bats can be messy houseguests. \"They're lovely, but they're problematic too,\" says Graeme Peart from St Margaret's Church, Saxlingham, just a few miles from Guestwick. He's responsible for the upkeep of the church - and says the bats started to become a nuisance about 15 years ago. \"There's the urine, the droppings,\" he says. \"One time there was a carpet leading up to the altar that became absolutely sodden with urine and droppings and had to be thrown away. They also destroyed the brass work.\"\n\nBats in Churches Church users are finding ways to live alongside wildlife\n\nBats are legally protected in the UK, so it's generally not possible to remove them. But the church has worked with the Bats in Churches team to find a solution - they've built a sealed-off loft conversion above the vestry. Ecologist Phillip Parker sets up his ladder to show us inside. \"The idea is that the bats that are in the main body of the church will live in here, rather than in the church itself,\" he explains. It's kitted out with CCTV cameras, allowing the team to monitor the animal's behaviour. \"What we have found is certain weeks during the year there'll be a hundred bats in here, and then suddenly they will disappear,\" says Parker. \"We don't know where they go, but they disappear for about 10 days, and then they'll come back again. And without the CCTV, we never knew that.\"\n\nBats in Churches The bat loft at St Margaret's sits above the vestry\n\nA major construction project like this takes time, effort and money. The new loft, and the continued monitoring of the bats, has cost about £50,000, funded through the Heritage Lottery Fund and other partners. Diana Spencer says there are other less costly solutions and grants are on offer from the Bat Conservation Trust. \"On a simple level, you can use sheets or covers over areas where things might be damaged. You can put wax coating on things like brass so that the urine doesn't damage it.\" She recommends that anyone who finds bats in a building should contact the National Bat Helpline for advice.\n\nBats in Churches As bats lose their habitats, churches are becoming a refuge for the animals",

More than 100 countries had gathered in London to approve a deal first agreed in April, which would have seen shipping become the world's first industry to adopt internationally mandated targets to reduce emissions. But US President Donald Trump had called the plan a \"green scam\" and representatives of his administration had threatened countries with tariffs if they voted in favour of it. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio declared the outcome a \"huge win\" for Trump.\n\nBut reflecting the pressure countries faced, the Secretary General of the International Maritime Organisation Arsenio Dominguez issued a \"plea\" for this not to be repeated. In a dramatic conclusion on Friday, when countries should have been voting to approve the deal, Saudi Arabia tabled a motion to adjourn the talks for a year. The chairman said this would mean that the agreement was not approved, as key timelines for the treaty would have to be revised. The motion passed by just a handful of votes. Hon. Ralph Regenvanu, Minister for Climate Change for the Republic of Vanuatu, said Saudi Arabia's motion was \"unacceptable given the urgency we face in light of accelerating climate change\". \"We came to London in reluctant support of the IMO's Net-Zero Framework. While it lacks the ambition that climate science demands, it does mark a significant step,\" he said. The shipping industry has been broadly supportive of the deal because it offered consistent global standards. Speaking after the talks ended, Thomas Kazakos, secretary-general of the industry body the International Chamber of Shipping, said : \"We are disappointed that member states have not been able to agree a way forward at this meeting.\" \"Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments,\" he added. The UK and most EU nations voted to continue the talks, but some countries including Greece went against the EU bloc and voted to abstain. The countries that voted in favour of adjourning the talks included Russia, Saudi Arabia and the US, who raised concerns that the deal would lead to price rises for consumers. Some key countries including China that had initially voted to support the deal in April agreed to delay proceedings. Island states Bahamas also changed their position and Antigua and Barbuda, who agreed in April, abstained. A delegate from the island states group told the BBC that these nations particularly rely on the US for trade and had been leaned on heavily by the Trump administration to change their position.",

    "text": "Australia's rainforests are releasing more carbon than they absorb, warn scientists\n\nThe lead author of the study, which was published in science journal Nature, said the findings have significant implications for global emissions reduction targets which are partly based on how ecosystems - such as rainforests - can absorb carbon.\n\nBut a study looking at data from Queensland forests found that extreme temperatures have caused more tree deaths than growths.\n\nRainforests are usually regarded as so-called \"carbon sinks\" as they absorb more emissions than they emit with new trees offsetting the carbon released by dead ones.\n\nAustralia's tropical rainforests have become the first in the world to release more carbon than they absorb, in a trend linked to climate change, a study has found.\n\n\"Current models may overestimate the capacity of tropical forests to help offset fossil fuel emissions,\" said Dr Hannah Carle of the Western Sydney University.\n\nWith fewer new trees, the report found that the trunks and branches of dead trees - known as woody biomass - became carbon emitters, rather than carbon absorbers, about 25 years ago.\n\n\"Forests help to curb the worst effects of climate change by absorbing some of the carbon dioxide released from burning fossil fuels, but our work shows this is under threat,\" said Dr Carle.\n\nDr Carle added that said an increase in trees dying in recent decades was due to climate change such as more extreme temperatures, atmospheric dryness and drought.\n\nBased on 49 years of data from 20 forests in Queensland, the report also found a rise in the number of cyclones and the severity of them was killing more trees and making it harder for new ones to grow.\n\n\"We have in this study evidence that Australia's moist tropical forests are the first of their kind globally to to exhibit this [woody biomass] change,\" Dr Carle said.\n\n\"And that's really significant. It could be a sort of canary in the coal mine.\"\n\nSenior author Patrick Meir also described the results as \"very concerning\", telling news agency AFP that it was \"likely that all tropical forests [would] respond fairly similarly\" - but added that more data and research would be needed to make a fair assessment.\n\nAustralia, one of the world's biggest polluters per capita, recently announced its new carbon reduction targets, pledging to cut emissions by at least 62% compared to 2005 levels over the next decade.\n\nThe country continues to face global criticism for its continued reliance on fossil fuels, with the government allowing one of the country's largest gas projects -Woodside's North West Shelf - to keep operating for another 40 years.\n\nLast month, a new report into the impact of climate change found Australia had already reached warming of above 1.5C and that no community would be immune from \"cascading, compounding and concurrent\" climate risks.",

He set up his camera trap after spotting fresh hyena tracks in the ghost town of Kolmanskop, Namibia. It took him ten years to get the shot, he said. The brown hyena, the rarest of all hyena species, is primarily nocturnal and tends to live a solitary life. For years, Mr van den Heever searched the deserted town, finding only traces of the elusive animal. \"I knew they were there, but actually photographing one was just never going to happen,\" he says he thought. He was awarded the prize at London's Natural History Museum. The annual exhibition dedicated to the competition opens at the Natural History Museum on 17 October. Keep scrolling to explore the full collection of award-winning images.\n\nAndrea Dominizi\n\nCategory: Junior Grand Prize and 15- to 17-year-old winner Title: After the Destruction Photographer: Andrea Dominizi, Italy Location: Lepini Mountains, Lazio, Italy While exploring the Lepini Mountains in central Italy, an area once logged for its old-growth beech trees, Andrea spotted a beetle resting on a cut log beside abandoned machinery. \"This photo shows the story and challenge faced by many animal species: habitat loss,\" he says. \"In this case, it's a beetle that loses the tree and the wood it needs to lay its eggs.\"\n\nCategory winners\n\nShane Gross\n\nCategory: Animals in their Environment Title: Like an Eel out of Water Photographer: Shane Gross, Canada Location: D'Arros Island, Amirante, Seychelles After weeks of patience, last year's winner, Shane Gross, captured peppered moray eels scavenging for carrion at low tide. He spent hours enduring the sun, heat, and flies, waiting where dead fish had washed up. Eventually, three eels appeared.\n\nJamie Smart\n\nCategory: 10 Years and Under category Title: The Weaver's Lair Photographer: Jamie Smart, UK Location: Mid-Wales, UK On a cold September morning, Jamie Smart discovered an orb-weaver spider curled up inside its silken hideaway. \"It's also quite special for me because I get to show something that people are usually afraid of,\" she says.\n\nSebastian Frölich\n\nCategory: Wetlands: The Bigger Picture Title: Vanishing Pond Photographer: Sebastian Frölich, Germany Location: Platzertal, Tyrol, Austria Sebastian Frölich visited Austria's Platzertal moorlands, a fragile wetland, to highlight its vital role as a carbon sink and a habitat for diverse wildlife, at a time when Austria has lost 90% of its peat bogs.\n\nLubin Godin\n\nCategory: 11–14 Years Title: Alpine Dawn Photographer: Lubin Godin, France Location: Col de la Colombière, Haute-Savoie, France During an early ascent, Lubin Godin found an Alpine ibex resting above a sea of clouds. He retraced his steps as the sun broke through and captured the scene before the mist returned.\n\nRalph Pace\n\nCategory: Underwater Title: Survival Purse Photographer: Ralph Pace, USA Location: Monterey Bay, California, USA Battling strong currents, Ralph Pace captured this image of a swell shark egg case, revealing a glowing embryo, complete with gill slits and a yolk sac. Swell sharks depend on kelp to lay their leathery eggs, making them vulnerable to kelp forest loss. Researchers believe Monterey Bay's kelp has declined by more than 95 per cent in the past 34 years.\n\nPhilipp Egger\n\nCategory: Animal Portraits Title: Shadow Hunter Photographer: Philipp Egger, Italy Location: Naturns, South Tyrol, Italy Philipp Egger observed this eagle owl's nest from afar for more than four years. Among the world's largest owls, eagle owls are about twice the weight of buzzards.

    "text": "Red Tractor ad banned for misleading environmental claims\n\n15 October 2025 Share Save Esme Stallard Climate and science reporter, BBC News Share Save\n\nRed Tractor The Red Tractor advert was last shown in 2023 but will now be banned for future use unless it is updated\n\nA TV advert by Red Tractor, the UK's biggest certifier of farm products on supermarket shelves, has been banned for exaggerating the scheme's environmental benefits and misleading the public. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) ruled the organisation had provided \"insufficient evidence\" that its farms complied with basic environmental laws to substantiate the claims in its ad. Environmental group River Action, which brought the complaint in 2023, said the ruling showed the scheme was \"greenwashing\" and urged supermarkets to stop using it. But Red Tractor called the watchdog's decision \"fundamentally flawed\" and argued that the scheme's focus was animal welfare not environmental standards.\n\nIn 2021, Red Tractor aired an advert in which it said: \"From field to store all our standards are met. When the Red Tractor's there, your food's farmed with care.\" You can watch it below.\n\nWatch: the ad banned by the Advertising Standards Authority\n\nThe environmental charity River Action took issue with the ad, which ran for a further two years, and complained to the watchdog that it suggested to consumers that Red Tractor farms will \"ensure a high degree of environmental protection\". The charity pointed to a report by the Environment Agency, released in 2020, which looked at how many breaches of environmental law there were on Red Tractor farms in the previous five years. The report concluded that these farms were \"not currently an indicator of good environmental performance\". After more than two years of investigation - one of the longest running - the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) upheld the complaint. It said that Red Tractor had failed to provide \"sufficient evidence\" that its farms met \"basic\" environmental laws and had a good environmental outcome to substantiate the claims in the ad. It also ruled that as a result the advert was \"misleading\" and \"exaggerated\" the benefits of the scheme. River Action welcomed the decision by the ASA and called on supermarkets to act. \"What this shows is that for their environmental credentials Red Tractor has been misleading the public and their suppliers,\" said Amy Fairman, head of campaigns at River Action. \"So, we're looking for suppliers like supermarkets to really examine and take stock of what is on their shelves.\" She added that challenging such adverts was important because of the risk to the environment from agricultural pollution. In 2022, the Environment Audit Committee concluded that agriculture was one of the most common factors preventing rivers from being in good health - affecting 40% of them. The risks to the environment include from slurry and pesticide runoff.\n\nBBC News/Tony Jolliffe Amy Fairman represents environmental charity River Action which campaigns for clean and healthy rivers\n\nBut Red Tractor, which assures 45,000 farms in the UK, have pushed back strongly, calling the finding by the ASA \"fundamentally flawed\". Jim Mosley, CEO of Red Tractor, told the BBC: \"They believe that we have implied an environmental claim. Nowhere in the voiceover or the imagery is any environmental claim actually made.\" He argued that the ASA only found a minority of people would think the advert meant Red Tractor farms had good environmental standards, and in fact the scheme is focused on other issues. \"Red Tractor's core purpose is food safety, animal welfare, and traceability. Whilst we have some environmental standards, they are a small part. And as a consequence, we leave that entirely to the Environment Agency to enforce environmental legislation,\" said Mr Moseley. When asked if that meant Red Tractor does not know if its farms are complying with environmental law, he said: \"Correct\".\n\nBut many supermarkets do refer to the environmental benefits of Red Tractor farms. Natalie Smith, Tesco's head of agriculture said last month, on the 25-year anniversary of Red Tractor: \"Certification schemes play a key role in providing reassurance for customers, and over the past 25 years, Red Tractor has established itself as a mark of quality, standing for… environmental protection.\" On Morrisons' website it states: \"100% of the fresh pork, beef, lamb, poultry, milk and cheddar cheese we sell in our stores comes from farms certified by Red Tractor, or an approved equivalent scheme, giving customers assurance… environmental protection.\" Both supermarkets were asked if they stood by the Red Tractor logo. Morrisons did not respond to a request for comment. A Tesco spokesperson said: \"We recognise there is still more to do, and it's essential that the Government and industry work together to drive change.\" It also referred the BBC to their industry body the British Retail Consortium. The consortium said that \"retailers remain committed to working with Red Tractor\", but that the organisation themselves are owners of the scheme.",

    "text": "Foul skies, fading light: How air pollution is stealing India's sunshine\n\n13 October 2025 Share Save Soutik Biswas India correspondent Share Save\n\nHindustan Times via Getty Images India faces a severe air pollution crisis, ranking among the world's top 10 most polluted countries\n\nIndia is losing sunlight. A new study by six Indian scientists finds that over the past three decades, sunshine hours - the time direct sunlight reaches the Earth's surface - have steadily declined across most of India, driven by clouds, aerosols and local weather. Data from 20 weather stations from 1988 to 2018 shows a persistent decline in sunshine hours nationwide, with only the northeast region seeing a mild seasonal reprieve, according to the paper published in Scientific Reports, a peer-reviewed journal published by Nature Portfolio. Scientists from Banaras Hindu University, the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology and the India Meteorological Department report that the steepest annual declines occurred in the northern inland region - notably Amritsar and Kolkata - as well as along the Himalayan belt and the west coast, particularly Mumbai. All of nine India's geograpically diverse regions showed an overall annual decline in sunshine hours, though the rate of decrease varied across India. Monthly analysis revealed significant increases from October to May, followed by sharp drops from June to July in six of the nine regions. This seasonal pattern of sunshine intersects with a deeper, long-standing problem: India's severe air pollution crisis - it's now among the world's top 10 polluted countries - which scientists trace back to the 1990s. Rapid urbanisation, industrial growth and land-use changes drove up fossil fuel use, vehicle emissions and biomass burning, sending aerosols into the atmosphere and dimming the Sun's rays.\n\nGetty Images Mumbai's sunshine hours are gradually declining, the scientists found\n\nIn winter, high air pollution from smog, temperature inversions and crop burning across the Indo-Gangetic plains produces light-scattering aerosols, which reduce sunshine hours. These aerosols - tiny solid or liquid particles from dust, vehicle exhaust, crop burning, and other sources - persist in the air long enough to affect sunlight, climate and health. During June-July, monsoon clouds blanket much of India, sharply reducing sunlight even though aerosol levels are lower than in winter. Scientists note that higher sunshine hours from October to May don't indicate cleaner air; rather, they reflect more cloud-free days. Hazy winter sunlight may scatter or diffuse, lowering intensity without entirely blocking sunshine, which instruments still record as sunshine hours. \"Our study found that shrinking sunshine hours are linked to clouds that linger longer without releasing rain, blocking more sunlight. These longer-lasting clouds form indirectly due to aerosols that alter weather and climate,\" says Manoj Kumar Srivastava, a professor of geophysics at the Banaras Hindu University, and one of the authors of the study. Aerosols have reduced the amount of sunlight reaching the ground in India by about 13%, while clouds accounted for an additional 31-44% drop in surface solar radiation between 1993 and 2022, according to Sachchida Nand Tripathi, an atmospheric scientist at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur. These patterns raise concerns for agriculture, daily life and India's solar energy ambitions, while highlighting where solar panels could be most effective. Solar now makes up 47% of India's renewable energy capacity. The government says it's on track for 500GW of renewables by 2030, with more than 100GW of solar installed as of early 2025. But declining sunlight could cast a shadow on the country's solar ambitions. According to Prof Tripathi, air pollution compounds the problem. It reduces solar panel output by 12-41% depending on the type of photovoltaic system - the technology that converts sunlight into electricity - and costs an estimated $245-835m in lost power generation.\n\nLightRocket via Getty Images India's solar ambitions could be dimmed by declining sunlight",

    "text": "Green turtle bounces back from brink in conservation 'win'\n\n10 October 2025 Share Save Helen Briggs BBC environment correspondent Share Save\n\nGetty Green turtles are large sea turtles found in tropical and subtropical oceans, known for their plant-based diet and reliance on beaches for nesting\n\nThe green turtle has been rescued from the brink of extinction in what scientists are calling a major conservation victory. Once hunted extensively for turtle soup, its eggs as a delicacy and decorative shells, the ancient mariner saw its numbers plummet and has been listed as endangered since the 1980s. Now, thanks to decades of global conservation efforts - from protecting eggs and releasing hatchlings on beaches, to reducing accidental capture in fishing nets - new data shows green turtle populations are rebounding. \"We must use this win as a catalyst to achieve numerous other wins,\" said Dr Nicolas Pilcher of the Marine Research Foundation, a non-profit based in Sabah, Malaysia.\n\nGetty Green turtle hatchling heading for the ocean after emerging from a nest buried in sand\n\nGreen turtles are one of the largest species of sea turtles, named for the greenish colour of their body fat, which comes from their plant-based diet. They are one of seven living species of sea turtles, two of which are critically endangered. Prof Brendan Godley, a conservation scientist at the University of Exeter, said green turtle populations in many parts of the world are showing signs of recovery due to conservation efforts over the last five decades, and while this work must continue for years to come, it gives cause for optimism. \"Sea turtles are iconic and charismatic species... they inspire people,\" he said. \"Hundreds of thousands of people have been working for decades to try and look after these creatures, and undoubtedly, it has had an impact.\" The conservation efforts include patrolling beaches, protecting females and their eggs at nesting sites, releasing hatchlings into the sea, education and awareness to reduce turtles being killed for meat and eggs, and using measures to stop turtles being captured in fishing nets.\n\nGetty A green sea turtle tangled in a fishing net off Pangasinan in the Philippines was rescued by local fishermen, tagged by environment officials, and safely released back into the sea\n\nThe latest Red List of endangered species was revealed at the IUCN (International Union for the Conservation of Nature) world congress in Abu Dhabi. The unenviable list now includes 172,620 species, of which 48,646 are threatened with extinction. Species are moved between categories when new data shows changes in their population, habitat or threats. If a species becomes more at risk - for example, its numbers fall or its habitat is damaged - it may be moved to a higher-risk category such as Endangered; if it recovers thanks to conservation efforts, it may shift to a lower-risk category like Near Threatened or Least Concern. The green turtle has been downgraded from Endangered to Least Concern. However, despite recent gains, green turtles are still far below their historic numbers due to past overexploitation and ongoing threats like fishing, habitat loss and climate change. In places like Raine Island, Australia, fewer baby turtles are hatching, showing that conservation efforts are still urgently needed.\n\nKit Kovacs Bearded seal pup on ice",

    "text": "'How growing a sunflower helped me fight anorexia'\n\n10 October 2025 Share Save Malcolm Prior and Jenny Kumah BBC News rural affairs team Share Save\n\nAndy Alcroft/BBC Emily Hough is now using her experiences to help shape nature prescribing schemes\n\nFor Emily Hough, nature was too often simply something \"out there\", a world apart from her, a view from a hospital window. Years spent in and out of specialist mental health units in Birmingham and London, being treated for the eating disorder she had had since the age of 12, meant she felt little connection with the countryside or interest in the everyday flora and fauna around her. That was until five years ago, when a hospital occupational therapist gave her an unusual prescription: Grow a sunflower. \"I'll be honest I'd never planted anything in my life,\" Ms Hough said.\n\n\"But I planted that sunflower and, just watching it grow, from me watering it and from me protecting it from the shade, helped me feel connected for the first time and really be able to appreciate what was around me - and how I can make a difference to nature and what nature can actually do for me. \"I was in a hospital at that point, so it was very limited. Fast forward five years, here we are today.\"\n\nGetty Images Green social prescribing encourages people to take part in nature-based activities to benefit their health and wellbeing\n\nFrom those early roots, Ms Hough, now 35, embraced what is formally called by the NHS \"green social prescribing\", where GPs and health practitioners refer patients to organisations that offer nature-based activities, whether that be hiking, birdwatching, rockpooling or looking after a city-based allotment. It is supposed to complement other more mainstream treatments and therapies and has been a key part of the government's 10-year plan for the NHS in England. The scheme may not work for everyone but for Ms Hough, who has now relocated from Solihull to a life in the countryside, the benefits have been profound. She is now out of hospital and has become what the NHS calls an \"Expert by Experience\" (EbE) - someone who uses that experience to design and evaluate new health services. She helped shape the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB)'s flagship \"nature prescription\" scheme for the West Midlands, launched earlier this year. On Friday – World Mental Health Day - the scheme marks the training of its 100th health professional, with enough resources to support 1,000 patients accessing nature-based activities.\n\nAndy Alcroft/BBC Dom Higgins, from the Wildlife Trusts, saids the evidence in favour of green social prescribing was clear\n\nBut the future of green social prescribing is uncertain. Despite a four-year national pilot that ended in March being judged a success by an independent evaluation of its first two years, there is concern that the onus for funding these schemes is being left to charities. Organisations, including The Wildlife Trusts, the RSPB and the Ocean Conservation Trust, are calling on the government to commit more funding to nature prescription schemes and to roll them out, beyond their initial seven trial areas. Dom Higgins, head of health and education for The Wildlife Trusts, said: \"It is unequivocal that nature improves mental health. \"I think the time for questioning the evidence is really over and people within the system and the NHS and decision makers get this. \"It's just we need the mechanism to make it available everywhere. It's time to seriously fund prevention and opportunities for people to create good health in the neighbourhoods where they live and work.\" The national pilot scheme saw nearly 8,500 people prescribed nature activities in its first two years, with more than half those patients living in socio-economically deprived areas. Chris Dayson, professor of voluntary action, health and wellbeing at Sheffield Hallam University, who was part of the team that evaluated the scheme, said it brought \"a really statistically significant increase in wellbeing\" for patients. The evaluation also found the scheme brought an economic social return - not least of all by getting people back into work - of £2.42 for every £1 invested. When approached by the BBC, the government did not comment on the future of green social prescribing but said the evaluation of the second two years of the trial scheme would be published \"in due course\".\n\n'Dramatic results'",

A new study of the bizarre naked mole rat shows that the animals have evolved a DNA repair mechanism that could explain their longevity. These burrow-dwelling rats have a maximum life span of nearly 40 years, making them the world's longest-lived rodent. The new findings, published in the journal Science, could also shed light on why naked mole rats are resistant to a wide range of age-related diseases.\n\nThe animals are resistant to cancer, deterioration of the brain and spinal cord, and arthritis, so many scientists want to understand more about how their bodies work. For this study, led by a team at Tonji University in Shanghai, China, the focus was DNA repair - a natural process in our bodies' cells. When strands of DNA - our genetic building blocks - are damaged, a mechanism is triggered whereby another undamaged strand of DNA is used as a template to repair the break. The focus of this research was on a particular protein that is involved in that system of damage sensing and repair. When a cell senses the damage, one of the substances it produces is a protein called c-GAS. That plays several roles, but what was of interest to these scientists is that in humans, it interferes with and hampers the process by which DNA is knitted back together. Scientists think that this interference could promote cancer and shorten our lifespan. In naked mole rats though, the researchers found that the exact same protein does the opposite. It helps the body mend strands of DNA and keeps the genetic code in each cell intact.

    "text": "Physics Nobel awarded to three scientists for work on quantum computing\n\n7 October 2025 Share Save Georgina Rannard Science reporter Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded to John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret and John M. Martinis for their work on quantum mechanics that is paving the way for a new generation of very powerful computers. \"There is no advanced technology used today that does not rely on quantum mechanics, including mobile phones, cameras... and fibre optic cables,\" said the Nobel committee. The announcement was made by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences at a news conference in Stockholm, Sweden. \"To put it mildly, it was a surprise of my life,\" said Professor John Clarke, who was born in Cambridge, UK and now works at the University of California in Berkeley.\n\nMichel H. Devoret was born in Paris, France and is a professor at Yale University while John M. Martinis is a professor at University of California, Santa Barbara. The three winners will share prize money of 11 million Swedish kronor (£872,000). The Nobel committee recognised breakthrough work performed by the three men in a series of experiments in the 1980s on electrical circuits. In the words of the committee, \"the discovery of macroscopic quantum mechanical tunnelling and energy quantisation in an electric circuit\". Even for a field often considered dense, this discovery sounds bewildering.\n\nGetty Images\n\nBut its implications have been profound and far-reaching. The electronic devices that most of us use rely on it, and the findings are being used to build extremely powerful computers. \"This is something that leads to development of the quantum computer. Many people are working on quantum computing, our discovery is in many ways the basis of this,\" said Prof Clarke on the phone to the news conference moments after he was told he had won. He appeared mystified that his work completed forty years ago is worthy of science's most prestigious prize. \"I'm completely stunned. At the time we did not realise in any way that this might be the basis for a Nobel prize,\" he said. Quantum mechanics relates to the behaviour of tiny things in a tiny world. It refers to what particles like the electron do in the sub-atomic world. Professor Clarke and his team looked at how these particles appeared to break rules like travelling through energy barriers that conventional physics said was impossible - something called \"tunnelling\". Using quantum \"tunnelling\", the electron manages to burrow through the energy barrier. Their work demonstrated that tunnelling can be reproduced not only in the quantum world, but also in electrical circuits in the 'real world'. This knowledge has been harnessed by scientists in making modern quantum chips. \"This is wonderful news indeed, and very well deserved,\" said Professor Lesley Cohen, Associate Provost in the Department of Physics at Imperial College London. \"Their work has laid the foundations for superconducting Qubits - one of the main hardware technologies for quantum technologies.\"\n\nPrevious winners of the Nobel Prize in Physics",

    "text": "The before and after images showing glaciers vanishing before our eyes\n\n5 October 2025 Share Save Mark Poynting Climate and science reporter, BBC News Share Save\n\nBBC\n\nWhen Matthias Huss first visited Rhône Glacier in Switzerland 35 years ago, the ice was just a short walk from where his parents would park the car. \"When I first stepped onto the ice... there [was] a special feeling of eternity,\" says Matthias. Today, the ice is half an hour from the same parking spot and the scene is very different. \"Every time I go back, I remember how it used to be,\" recalls Matthias, now director of Glacier Monitoring in Switzerland (GLAMOS), \"how the glacier looked when I was a child.\" There are similar stories for many glaciers all over the planet, because these frozen rivers of ice are retreating - fast. In 2024, glaciers outside the giant ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica lost 450 billion tonnes of ice, according to a recent World Meteorological Organization report. That's equivalent to a block of ice 7km (4.3 miles) tall, 7km wide and 10km deep - enough water to fill 180 million Olympic swimming pools. \"Glaciers are melting everywhere in the world,\" says Prof Ben Marzeion of the Institute of Geography at the University of Bremen. \"They are sitting in a climate that is very hostile to them now because of global warming.\" Switzerland's glaciers have been particularly badly hit, losing a quarter of their ice in the last 10 years, measurements from GLAMOS revealed this week. \"It's really difficult to grasp the extent of this melt,\" explains Dr Huss. But photos - from space and the ground - tell their own story. Satellite images show how the Rhône Glacier has changed since 1990, when Dr Huss first visited. At the front of the glacier is a lake where there used to be ice.\n\nUntil recently, glaciologists in the Alps used to consider 2% of ice lost in a single year to be \"extreme\". Then 2022 blew that idea out of the water, with nearly 6% of Switzerland's remaining ice lost in a single year. That has been followed by significant losses in 2023, 2024 and now 2025 too. Regine Hock, professor of glaciology at the University of Oslo, has been visiting the Alps since the 1970s. The changes over her lifetime are \"really stunning\", she says, but \"what we see now is really massive changes within a few years\". The Clariden Glacier, in north-eastern Switzerland, was roughly in balance until the late 20th Century - gaining about as much ice through snowfall as it lost to melting. But this century, it's melted rapidly.\n\nFor many smaller glaciers, like the Pizol Glacier in the north-east Swiss Alps, it's been too much. \"This is one of the glaciers that I observed, and now it's completely gone,\" says Dr Huss. \"It definitely makes me sad.\"\n\nPhotographs allow us to look even further back in time. The Gries Glacier, in southern Switzerland near the Italian border, has retreated by about 2.2km (1.4 miles) in the past century. Where the end of the glacier once stood is now a large glacial lake.\n\nIn south-east Switzerland, the Pers Glacier once fed the larger Morteratsch Glacier, which flows down towards the valley. Now the two no longer meet.\n\nAnd the largest glacier in the Alps, the Great Aletsch, has receded by about 2.3km (1.4 miles) over the past 75 years. Where there was ice, there are now trees.\n\nGlaciers have grown and shrunk naturally for millions of years, of course. In the cold snaps of the 17th, 18th and 19th Centuries - part of the Little Ice Age - glaciers regularly advanced. During this time, many were considered cursed by the devil in Alpine folklore, their advances linked to spiritual forces as they threatened hamlets and farmland. There are even tales of villagers calling on priests to talk to the spirits of glaciers and get them to move up the mountain. Glaciers began their widespread retreat across the Alps in about 1850, though the timing varied from place to place. That coincided with rising industrialisation, when burning of fossil fuels, particularly coal, began to heat up our atmosphere, but it's hard to disentangle natural and human causes that far back in time. Where there is no real doubt is that the particularly rapid losses of the past 40 years or so are not natural.\n\nWithout humans warming the planet - by burning fossil fuels and releasing huge amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) – glaciers would be expected to be roughly stable. \"We can only explain it if we take into account CO2 emissions,\" confirms Prof Marzeion. What is even more sobering is that these large, flowing bodies of ice can take decades to fully adjust to the rapidly warming climate. That means that, even if global temperatures stabilised tomorrow, glaciers would continue to retreat. \"A large part of the future melt of the glaciers is already locked in,\" explains Prof Marzeion. \"They are lagging climate change.\"\n\nBut all is not lost. Half of the ice remaining across the world's mountain glaciers could be preserved if global warming is limited to 1.5C above \"pre-industrial\" levels of the late 1800s, according to research published this year in the journal Science. Our current trajectory is leading us towards warming of about 2.7C above pre-industrial levels by the end of this century – which would see three-quarters of ice lost eventually. That extra water going into rivers and eventually the oceans means higher sea levels for coastal populations around the world. But the loss of ice will be particularly acutely felt by mountain communities dependent on glaciers for fresh water. Glaciers are a bit like giant reservoirs. They collect water as snowfall - which turns into ice - during cold, wet periods, and release it as meltwater during warm periods. This meltwater helps to stabilise river flows during hot, dry summers - until the glacier disappears. The loss of that water resource has knock-on effects for all those who rely on glaciers - for irrigation, drinking, hydropower and even shipping traffic. Switzerland is not immune from those challenges, but the implications are much more profound for the high mountains of Asia, referred to by some as the Third Pole due to the volume of ice. About 800 million people rely at least partly on meltwater from glaciers there, particularly for agriculture. That includes the upper Indus river basin, which serves parts of China, India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. In regions with drier summers, meltwater from ice and snow can be the only significant source of water for months. \"That's where we see the biggest vulnerability,\" says Prof Hock. So how do scientists feel when confronted by the future prospects of glaciers in a warming world? \"It's sad,\" says Prof Hock. \"But at the same time, it's also empowering. If you decarbonise and reduce the [carbon] footprint, you can preserve glaciers. \"We have it in our hands.\"\n\nTop image: Tschierva Glacier, Swiss Alps, in 1935 and 2022.

    "text": "Environment prize nominees 'heroes of our time', says William\n\n4 October 2025 Share Save Daniela Relph Senior royal correspondent Share Save\n\nKensington Palace/PA Wire\n\nThe Prince of Wales has described those in the running for his environmental Earthshot prize as \"heroes of our time\". Prince William will travel to Rio de Janeiro next month for the ceremony - the first time the awards have been hosted in Latin America. The prize, created by the prince five years ago, awards £1m every year to five projects for their environmental innovations. There have been almost 2,500 nominees this year from 72 countries - this year's winners will be chosen by Prince William and his Earthshot Prize Council which includes the actor, Cate Blanchett and Jordan's Queen Rania. This year's list of finalists range from a Caribbean country to small start-up businesses.\n\nThe Earthshot Prize is a 10-year project with past ceremonies held in London, Boston, Singapore and Cape Town. Kensington Palace confirmed earlier this year that the main awards ceremony will be held at Rio de Janeiro's Museum of Tomorrow on 5 November.\n\nBarbados has been nominated for its global leadership on climate with the island on track to become fossil-free by 2030. The Chinese city of Guangzhou is shortlisted in the \"Clean our Air\" category for electrification of its public transport system. Prince William previously said he would like to take the Earthshot Prize to China. Finally, what has been billed as the world's first fully \"upcycled skyscraper\" makes the final list too. Sydney's Quay Quarter Tower was one of thousands of 20th century towers now reaching the end of their lifespans.\n\nInstead of demolition, which releases vast amounts of carbon and waste, a coalition of architects, engineers, building contractors and developers has effectively \"upcycled\" the original structure. \"Matter\" is the only British finalist in the line-up. Based in Bristol, the business has developed a filter for washing machines removing the greatest cause of microplastics in our oceans. \"I feel like winning an Earthshot prize for me would be like winning an Olympic gold medal,\" said Adam Root, the founder of Matter.\n\nReuters In 2024, Actor Billy Porter and Earthshot ambassadors Robert Irwin and Nomzamo Mbatha joined the Prince of Wales on stage at the awards\n\nIn a video message released to mark the announcement of this year's finalists, he reflected on the past five years. \"Back then, a decade felt a long time. George was seven, Charlotte, five, and Louis two; the thought of them in 2030 felt a lifetime away,\" said Prince William. \"But today, as we stand halfway through this critical decade, 2030 feels very real. \"2030 is a threshold by which future generations will judge us; it is the point at which our actions, or lack of them, will have shaped forever the trajectory of our planet.\" He added: \"The people behind these projects are heroes of our time, so let us back them. Because, if we do, we can make the world cleaner, safer and full of opportunity - not only for future generations, but for the lives we want to lead now.\"",

    "text": "Dame Jane Goodall revolutionised our understanding of our closest primate cousins\n\n1 October 2025 Share Save Victoria Gill Science correspondent Share Save\n\nWatch: Jane Goodall tells BBC how she became interested in animals\n\nShe was a serene force of nature. And she never wavered in her mission to help the animals to which she dedicated her life. When I interviewed Dame Jane Goodall last year, she exuded calm, even as she pressed home to me that a great extinction crisis was facing our planet. Over a slightly blurry video call, I could see her toy monkey, Mr H, behind her. That toy was given to her nearly 30 years ago by a friend. Dr Goodall, who was 90 years old when we spoke, was still travelling the world with Mr H at her side. Researchers I've spoken to this evening, whose work Dr Goodall inspired, or who were simply inspired by her energy, are in shock at her death aged 91. Conservationist Dame Jane Goodall dies aged 91 Professor Cat Hobaiter, from the University of St Andrews, who has worked with Chimpanzees - studying their communication - for more than 15 years, told me that one reason Dr Goodall had such an impact was that \"she gave up doing what she loved - spending time with her beloved chimpanzees - to tirelessly travel the world and share her passion with everyone she met.\" In the many years that Jane Goodall observed and studied chimpanzees, she revolutionised our understanding of our closest primate cousins. Key to her groundbreaking discoveries were her curiosity and ability - quietly - to observe.\n\nGetty Images Dr Goodall \"gave up doing what she loved... to tirelessly travel the world and share her passion\"\n\nIt was during her time in the rainforest reserve at Gombe, in Tanzania, when she stopped to spend time watching a male chimpanzee who was foraging. The chimp took a twig, bent and stripped it of its leaves, then he poked it into a termite's nest. He then used that stripped, bent twig to spoon the termites into his mouth. That observation - in 1960 - challenged the belief that only humans made and used tools. Even as she changed our understanding of the natural world, Dr Goodall faced cynicism and sexism. She was not formally trained as a scientist. And, in the 1960s, that was unusual. Her work in Gombe went on to show that chimps also form strong family bonds - and even that they engage in warfare over territory. But her approach – associating so closely with the animals she studied, naming them and even referring to them as \"my friends\" - made her unpopular with the male-dominated scientific establishment. Her supervisor and mentor, Professor Louis Leakey, saw the value in that informality. \"He wanted somebody whose mind wasn't messed up by the reductionist attitude of science to animals,\" she said.\n\nGetty Images Dr Goodall was still travelling the world into her 90s with her toy monkey, Mr H, at her side",

    "text": "Hospital failings continued after Alice Figueiredo death, leaked documents show\n\n1 day ago Share Save Alison Holt, social affairs editor and James Melley, senior producer Share Save\n\nFamily handout Alice Figueiredo's family hoped lessons would be learned following their 22-year-old daughter's death\n\nWarning: This article contains upsetting details and references to serious self-harm and death Just four months after a young woman died in a London mental health unit, another patient tried to harm herself in startlingly similar circumstances, leaked documents seen by the BBC show. Alice Figueiredo, a patient at Goodmayes Hospital, which is run by North East London Mental Health Trust (NELFT), attempted to harm herself using plastic or bin bags on 18 occasions, mostly taking them from the same shared toilet. On the 19th occasion, in July 2015, she managed to take her own life. Just four months later, in November 2015, another young woman also on Hepworth ward attempted to harm herself using a bin bag. She survived. Mental health campaigners say it suggests a worrying failure to learn from tragedies. \"It's shocking and distressing that this was still going on four months after Alice died,\" says Jane Figueiredo, Alice's mother. \"The bin bags could and should definitely have been removed, but instead patients continued to be put at unnecessary risk.\" NELFT says all bin bags have been removed and \"it is committed to learning from every incident and continuously improving\" the care it provides.\n\nNELFT and former ward manager Benjamin Aninakwa are due to be sentenced this week after an Old Bailey jury concluded they had not done enough to keep 22-year-old Alice Figueiredo safe. The BBC has spoken to former NELFT patients, families and ex-staff who have experience of the trust's community and hospital services over the 10 years since Alice's death. They raise concerns about poor management, record-keeping, risk assessments and staff shortages stretching over that decade. An email, which gives details of the November 2015 incident, was submitted to an internal inquiry commissioned by the trust after Alice's parents complained about the care she had received. The inquiry's report, which has been seen by the BBC, has never been made public.\n\nHepworth ward offered inpatient mental health care for women at Goodmayes Hospital\n\n\"The similarities between this young woman and [Alice Figueiredo] are startling in terms of presentation, age range, background,\" the email said. It goes on to say while it appears there has been \"some learning\" since Alice's death, there was \"significant evidence\" that not all incidents were being properly reported. The hospital used an NHS risk management system called Datix where incidents should be logged on the system to help identify risks and patterns of behaviour. The report says during the time Alice was on the ward there were 81 incidents or near misses that met the criteria for being reported via Datix, but just 14 (17.2%) were logged on the system. In the November case, there was also significant under-reporting. The report suggests that of 45 self-harm events involving the unidentified young woman, 27 do not appear on the risk management system, including the attempt to harm herself using a bin bag.\n\nThe general lack of recording on the ward meant \"opportunities to safely manage patients were missed\", the inquiry found. NELFT says it has removed plastic bags from wards in line with national guidance, and improved record-keeping and case management.\n\nOverall, the internal report paints a picture of a ward where there were very sick patients, staff shortages - particularly of nurses - and a poor relationship between ward manager Benjamin Aninakwa and the consultant psychiatrist. The report also says 100% of the support workers assigned to observe Alice one to one were temporary staff. Brian Dow, from the mental health charity Rethink, says the document shows the unit did not act quickly enough after Alice's death to protect other patients. \"Lessons should be learned, and you should not expect to see a repetition of the same risks and the same dangers just weeks afterwards,\" he said. \"You need to have a culture of openness and transparency so that you can learn from the mistakes.\"\n\nFamily handout Alice befriended other patients while on Hepworth ward\n\n\"Jenny\", not her real name, was a patient on Hepworth ward at the same time as Alice. They became close friends. She says rather than an open and transparent culture on the ward, the atmosphere felt difficult and intimidating to her. She shared the statement she had made to police investigating Alice's death with the BBC. In it she remembers how Alice helped her cope. \"She used to wake me up every morning on Hepworth ward with a big hug,\" she says. She describes how staff meant to be looking after them were often not doing the necessary checks or observations. \"On countless occasions I witnessed Alice asking to speak to members of staff who were supposed to be doing observations on her but were instead busy on their phones,\" she wrote. She also told police that observation records detailing what patients had been doing, which are important in giving clinicians a sense of how that person is coping, were often falsified.\n\nJenny left Goodmayes Hospital before Alice died. She is now living in her own home with support in the community, although she still misses her friend. The BBC has previously highlighted repeated criticisms of the trust by coroners, with the most recent concerns being raised in May 2025 following the death of a 37-year-old man under the care of NELFT's community-based team. The most common criticisms are about the poor quality of record-keeping, risk assessments, risk management and care planning. Staff shortages and poor communication are also highlighted in a number of reports over the last decade. Former staff who have spoken to the BBC have raised similar concerns. Mark New was a senior support worker in the trust's community mental health team. He says it was a good place to work for most of the 15 years he was there, but things deteriorated to such an extent that he resigned earlier this year. He says mandatory medical and care management reviews were not always happening, leaving some patients' conditions untreated, and some \"were languishing in crisis for weeks… for months\".\n\n\"All of this was being fed back to staff in charge, but it wasn't really being acknowledged,\" he says. The trust operated a traffic light system on patient files to indicate their level of need and the risk they posed to themselves or others. Mr New says these files were often not filled out accurately or updated properly, including risk assessments. Mr New remembers one client who was flagged green or low risk. He later discovered they had recently been picked up by police following allegations of \"assault and hostage-taking with a bladed weapon\". The trust says it is sorry if any staff member felt unsupported or unsafe, and acknowledges that \"workforce pressures have historically impacted the quality of care across the NHS.\" It says it has made substantial investment in recruiting and retaining staff. \"We need a health system that prevents people ending up in crisis,\" says Brian Dow from Rethink. \"Too often we hear stories of people escalating unnecessarily.\" Alice Figueiredo's mother, Jane, and stepfather, Max, have spent the last decade seeking justice and transparency over what happened to her. \"We should be able to expect safe, compassionate and diligent care for some of the most vulnerable people in society,\" says Jane. \"Urgent action is needed, not just at NELFT, but in all mental health hospitals, wards and services around the country.\" NELFT says it is sorry for Alice's death and it remains \"dedicated to ensuring that Alice's memory continues to inspire positive change\" and will \"continue to work tirelessly to deliver safer, more compassionate care for the communities we serve\". The BBC understands that Benjamin Aninakwa, who still works at NELFT, is appealing against his conviction for failure to take reasonable care for the health and safety of others affected by acts or omissions at work. He was acquitted of gross negligence manslaughter.",

Paul Rees, appointed head of the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) in July, told The Independent that neonatal nurse Letby should have been suspended after she was first arrested in July 2018. Letby remained free to work at the Countess of Chester Hospital without any restrictions imposed by the NMC until she was charged in November 2020. The now 35-year-old, originally from Hereford, is serving 15 whole-life prison sentences after being convicted of murdering seven babies and attempting to murder seven others between 2015 and 2016, one of whom on two occasions.\n\n'Public inquiry'\n\nRevised NMC rules now mean investigators no longer have to wait until a nurse is charged before they can issue a temporary suspension order. Mr Rees said: \"We've changed the guidance, so it is clear now where there is an exceptional case of serious criminal wrongdoing, we take action and implement an interim order. \"It's incumbent upon us to move fast and bring about these interim orders.\" Asked if he expected the NMC to be criticised by the public inquiry examining the authorities' responses to Letby's crimes, Mr Rees replied: \"We don't know yet, but it's a possibility because we should've acted faster.\" Lady Justice Thirlwall's final report is due to be published next year.\n\nPA Media Lucy Letby worked in the neonatal unit at the Countess of Chester Hospital",

    "text": "New flu virus mutation could see 'worst season in a decade'\n\n2 days ago Share Save James Gallagher Health and science correspondent Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nListen to James read this article Flu strikes every winter, but this year something seems to be different. A seasonal flu virus suddenly mutated in the summer. It appears to evade some of our immunity, has kick-started a flu season more than a month early, and is a type of flu that history suggests is more severe. The NHS has now issued a \"flu jab SOS\" as fears grow that this will add up to a brutal winter. There is a lot of nuance and uncertainty, but leading flu experts have told me they would not be shocked if this was the worst flu season for a decade. \"We haven't seen a virus like this for a while, these dynamics are unusual,\" says Prof Nicola Lewis, the director of the World Influenza Centre at the Francis Crick Institute. \"It does concern me, absolutely,\" she adds. \"I'm not panicking, but I am worried.\"\n\nSo what's going on? And what can we do? Scientists track the evolution of influenza viruses because they mutate constantly and the seasonal flu vaccine has to be updated each year to keep up. This evolution happens in a rhythm known as \"shift and drift\". Most of the time the virus drifts along making minor changes and then every so often there is a sudden abrupt shift as the virus mutates substantially. That happened in June this year. Seven mutations appeared in a strain of H3N2 seasonal flu and led to a \"fast increase\" in reports of the mutated virus, says Prof Derek Smith, director of the centre for pathogen evolution at the University of Cambridge.\n\nGetty Images H3N2 strain of influenza\n\nUnusually, this happened outside flu season, in the middle of the northern hemisphere's summer. \"It almost certainly will sweep the world, so from that standpoint, it's something that will come up quickly,\" says Prof Smith. By September, as children went back to school, the nights drew in and the temperatures started to drop, there was an uptick in cases. Exactly what the mutations are doing is still being explored, but they are probably helping the virus to evade some of the immunity we have built up over years of flu infections and vaccines. The result is the virus is finding it easier to infect people and spread – that is why the flu season is so early in the UK and other countries, including Japan.\n\nIf the virus can spread more easily then it does not have to wait for more favourable wintery conditions – when we spend more time indoors with the heating on and the windows shut – to start the flu season. \"We're miles ahead,\" says Prof Lewis. \"I think it's going to be a strong flu season.\" If you remember your R numbers from the pandemic (that is the number of people each infected person passes the virus onto), they suggest the new mutant has an edge. Seasonal flu usually has an R number of around 1.2, while the early estimate for this year is 1.4, says Prof Lewis. So very roughly, if 100 people had flu, they would pass it to 120 in a typical year, and 140 this year.\n\nWorst flu season for a decade?\n\n\"It's highly likely it's going to be a bad flu season and it's going to happen quite soon - we're already well into it,\" says Prof Christophe Fraser, from the Pandemic Sciences Institute at the University of Oxford. \"There are indicators that this could be worse than some of the flu seasons we've seen in the last 10 years.\" In a typical flu season, around one-in-five of us get infected, but that could be higher this year, he warns. But all these predictions are still clouded in uncertainty. Some look to Australia for clues as it had the worst flu season on record this year, although it did not face the same mutated H3N2 we have. We know the virus is spreading very well in children in the germ-fest that is the school playground. But the immunity a 10-year-old has developed will be very different from that of their grandparents, whose immune defences may have been shaped by six times as many flu seasons. So experts will be watching closely as the virus starts infecting older age groups in the coming weeks.\n\n'It's a nastier virus'\n\nHistory suggests that the form of influenza we are facing this year is more severe, particularly for older people. There are multiple types of flu and you may have heard some of the names like H1N1 swine flu, which caused a pandemic in 2009, or H5N1, the current flu killing birds around the world. The fresh mutations have happened in a group of H3N2 influenzas. \"H3 is always a hotter virus, it's a nastier virus, it's more impactful on the population,\" says Prof Lewis. It is worth remembering that some of us will get flu and develop no symptoms at all, while others get a sudden fever, body aches and exhaustion - but the virus can be deadly in older and more vulnerable groups. Last year, nearly 8,000 people died from flu, and in the 2022-23 flu season there were nearly 16,000 deaths. The NHS is already anticipating a tough flu season. So what can we do about it? The clear advice is to get the seasonal flu vaccine – the NHS in England issued a \"flu jab SOS\", saying there were 2.4 million vaccine slots available in the next week.\n\nGetty Images",

    "text": "Ever feel the need to switch off? Your vagus nerve might hold the key\n\n2 days ago Share Save Ruth Clegg Health and wellbeing reporter Share Save\n\nAlamy\n\nIt's the body's superhighway that carries information from your brain to your major organs. You might not have a clue it exists - let alone that you might need to train it. But a quick scroll through my social media and there's a whole array of tips on the vagus nerve - how to heal it, stimulate it, even reset it - all to apparently reduce stress and anxiety levels. Poking your ear with what looks like a rubber toothbrush, moving your eyes from side to side, tapping your body or gargling water while wearing a weighted vest - these are just some of the techniques being recommended to train that nerve and improve your wellbeing. With our stress levels sky-high, and burnout on the rise among under-35s, it's no wonder many of the posts on socials have gone viral with millions of hits. Some of these methods might seem a bit absurd. But is it really possible to train your mighty internal messenger, and could that actually bring quick relief to life's stresses?\n\n@cariad.connection Yoga therapist Eirian Collinge uses breathwork, eye movements, and tapping in her practice\n\nI decided to find out by coming to small candle-lit studio in Stockport town centre - where I find myself in a small group, humming loudly. Humming, I am told, can help stimulate our vagus nerve and slow down our heart rate. And I do start to feel a bit more relaxed. I can feel the low hum vibrating in my body and my brain seems a bit less busy. At this somatics class, yoga therapist Eirian Collinge guides us through a session of gentle moves combining deep breathing, rocking and swaying. While she doesn't buy into all the techniques on socials, Eirian says there are parts of her practice that use breathwork, eye movements and tapping. But, she says, \"it's a process\" and there's no quick fix. It is rooted in a theory that suggests we can calm down our nervous system by connecting with our bodies. Some scientists say this is an over-simplification of our complex internal systems. But others say it can be effective in helping us find a snippet of calm in a busy, intense world. Sarah, who is lying down just a few mats away from me, started coming to this class about a year ago. She says the practice has been life-changing. \"I actually cried after the first session,\" she says. \"It felt like the first time my brain has ever switched off.\" The 35-year-old, who struggles with her mental health, says it feels like she is \"flossing her brain\".\n\nXander Xander says he now knows what to do when he is overwhelmed, like going for a run in the muddy hills\n\nSarah's partner, Xander, agrees. It's made him more aware of his feelings. \"As a man,\" he explains, \"We are not really programmed to do that. \"I've struggled with depression for most of my adult life, but now, instead of trying to fix my thoughts I can sit with my emotions and accept them. \"If things get a bit much for me I can peel back a little from work. Go for a run, get out in the hills, for example. \"Understanding my nervous system is a huge part of that.\" The vagus - Latin for \"wandering\" - starts in the brain as two main branches - left and right - that connect to every major organ, constantly relaying vital information back and forth. It's part of the autonomic nervous system, which controls things we don't think about, like breathing, heart rate and digestion.\n\nThe system, in part, is made up of: the sympathetic nervous system - which triggers \"fight or flight\", preparing us for anything from being chased by a wild animal to that all important job interview, and\n\nthe parasympathetic nervous system - which relies on the vagus nerve to help put the brakes on and brings the body back into a state of calm If one of these is out of sync we start to see problems. But can we really reset the balance ourselves, by attempting to activate the vagus nerve? Consultant psychiatrist Prof Hamish McAllister-Williams is sceptical. \"We have good evidence vagus nerve stimulation can help with neurological disorders like epilepsy and mental illnesses like treatment-resistant depression,\" he says, \"but that comes from a device that is fitted in the body - a bit like a pacemaker which sends pulses of electrical energy to the vagus nerve.\" That device sends mild electrical stimulations through the vagus nerve to the brain, sparking a release of chemicals like serotonin and dopamine which help us regulate our mood. While vagus nerve stimulation inside the body requires invasive surgery and is available for a small cohort of patients on the NHS, there is now a growing market for wearable - non-invasive - technology. These devices, which cost anything from £200 to more than £1,000, tend to be clipped on the ear, worn round the neck or placed on the chest.\n\n@lucylambertco Lucy was burnt out and felt she had nowhere to turn before discovering these devices\n\n\"The are some credible studies that suggest these external stimulators can potentially impact on brain activity,\" Prof McAllister-Williams explains. \"But there is a lot less evidence than for the internal devices.\" With external devices, the electrical impulses need to travel through skin, tissue, muscle and fat so it's not as simple and direct as a stimulator in the body. After she experienced burnout, Lucy Lambert says such non-invasive vagus nerve stimulators helped her. The mother-of-three left her job as a primary school teacher because she was so completely \"stressed, tired and anxious\". \"I had been running on empty for so long - I didn't realise,\" Lucy says. \"Then it hit. The to-do list of life became too much. \"The mental load was so huge I couldn't get out of bed.\" After exhausting various medical routes and feeling like she was getting nowhere, Lisa's brother recommended one of these devices which vibrates, claiming to send low-level electrical pulses to the vagus nerve, often through the skin in the neck or ear area. \"I noticed that when I started to feel overwhelmed, I would get a headache first. \"I would then wear a device for 10 minutes twice a day; the pain from the headache would go, and my whole body would calm down. \"The vibrations, they really do something.\" She says the devices didn't fix burnout but they helped her create \"conditions where real healing can happen\".\n\n@lucylambertco Lucy has a range of non-invasive vagus nerve stimulators which she uses along with taking time out and slowing down her pace of life",

But is it any easier to get an appointment?\n\n3 days ago Share Save Nick Triggle Health correspondent Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nGP Dr David Turner no longer sees patients on a Wednesday morning. Instead, he spends that time sifting through the online appointment requests to work out what each patient needs. Last week there were 84 requests, and the week before it was more than 100. \"It's relentless - you get about two minutes to look at each,\" Dr Turner says. \"We're getting lots of requests we would not have had previously - questions like, 'Should I take this food supplement?' Previously patients would not have bothered GPs with things like that. \"Obviously, the concern is there is something serious buried in there - I know of a practice which only realised at 6:20pm there was a patient that needed an urgent home visit. If they had come through on the phone it would have been recognised straight away.\" Dr Turner's Hertfordshire practice started complying with a new government directive to offer online booking for non-urgent appointments across England in September.\n\nDr David Turner Dr David Turner spends a lot of time sifting through online booking requests since the new system came into force\n\nThe idea is make it easier for patients to book non-urgent appointments or ask questions - and end the 08:00 scramble to get through on the telephone and, in turn, free up lines for urgent cases. But the increased administrative workload for doctors means the practice is now offering fewer appointments overall. \"I'm not sure the government has properly thought this through,\" Dr Turner says. His union, the British Medical Association, is so worried it has opened a formal dispute with the government about the new approach, warning GPs are going to be overwhelmed and that could put patients at risk. This opens the option of the BMA introducing a work-to-rule limiting the number of patients GPs will agree to see. But how do patients feel? Members of the public told Your Voice, Your BBC News that while the online system is welcome it is being undermined by the long-standing problem of a lack of available appointments.\n\n'There's still no appointments'\n\nJo Jo has had difficulties getting an appointment online - but says other digital NHS services are working well\n\nJo, 53, a former finance director for a private hospital who lives in Kent, has tried using the online system - but there have been no slots available. She has regular contact with her GP surgery as she is on thyroid medication after having half her larynx removed because of a benign tumour. \"My practice is meeting the requirement for online booking, but what's the point if you can't get an appointment?\" However, Jo's dissatisfaction goes further than just getting access. \"I know staff are really busy, but sometimes their attitude is so dismissive and frankly rude,\" she says. \"I went in for a blood test recently and the nurse was so abrupt. They don't realise how frightening it is when you are concerned about your health. If they did, they would show more empathy.\" But Jo acknowledges there are other aspects of the digital evolution in the NHS that are improving services. She is able to order repeat prescriptions online and after getting her blood tests done she accessed the results on the NHS app. \"It does make it so much easier for someone like me, but we need to remember not all people are digitally savvy,\" Jo says. \"My dad hasn't got a smartphone - so someone like him won't see the benefit.\" This is something feedback to Healthwatch England has found too. Over the last month it has been monitoring what patients have been reporting to its local branches about the online appointments system. It says while some have reported it has helped speed up bookings, others fear being marginalised because they are not comfortable with the technology.\n\n'GP practices make good money – services should be better'\n\nRakesh Rakesh says it has become more difficult to get an appointment after the pandemic - and online bookings haven't changed that\n\nRakesh, who lives in Southampton, has had a similar experience to Jo. \"I've tried the online portal and you can book for six weeks in advance, but there are never any slots available. You are then stuck on the phone hoping to get through.\" \"You have more chance of winning the lottery than seeing a GP,\" Rakesh says, jokingly. The 65-year-old says he is lucky though as he remains pretty healthy and does not need to use his GP much. \"I feel sorry for people with health problems who need to see a GP regularly. It's definitely got worse over recent years. I noticed a change after the pandemic - it got much harder to see a GP, certainly in person.\" Rakesh, who used to be a merchant shipping captain and now works as a safety auditor in the industry, feels GPs should be doing more to improve access – or at least the GP partners that run the practices. He points to the profit they make - GP practices are effectively small businesses and the latest available figures show the average partner earns more than £150,000 each year. \"They are very profitable businesses,\" Rakesh says. \"I don't think this is a matter of money.\" His displeasure is clear - and it is something many share. The long-running British Social Attitudes survey shows satisfaction with GP care hit its lowest level since records began last year with fewer than a third of people happy with services.\n\n'I get a great service'\n\nNot everyone is dissatisfied though. Stephen's practice introduced online booking a year ago and he has used it three times to great effect. \"Each time, I've got a message back quickly offering an appointment or asking for extra information. On one occasion I even got a same-day appointment,\" says the 67-year-old, from Chelmsford. \"It's so much better than being stuck waiting in a phone queue.\" The most recent time Stephen used the online booking system was as a result of pain and weakness in his hand. He was referred for physiotherapy and was able to receive treatment at his local GP practice. This is part of a nationwide scheme launched by the Conservative government giving practices extra funding to recruit physiotherapists, pharmacists and dieticians. \"It's really convenient,\" says Stephen. \"I've also seen a pharmacist for a medicine review for migraines, and I've had a blood test done there too. In the past we would have had to go to hospital or elsewhere for these.\"\n\n'Maybe we should start charging to see a GP'\n\nPatricia, who is in her 70s and lives in Surrey, is sympathetic to the pressure on GPs. She, too, has found it hard to get appointments through the online booking system, but says it is at least easy to use. \"When I last tried to use it there was nothing for weeks, so you still have to rely on getting through on the phone.\" Patricia suffers from back problems and needed some medication to control the pain. \"It is something that flares up from time to time. I once had to ring 999 and paramedics came out. But they could not issue a prescription - they had to phone up to get one. It all seems so inefficient,\" she says. \"But I know the service is under tremendous pressure. I think we need to re-think our approach.\" Patricia has a house in France and has used GP services there. \"You pay small fee to go - and it is so much quicker and easier. It would encourage the public to use services more responsibly. You would need to have some form of means testing. But we pay to see a dentist, why not a GP? It's worth considering.\" This is an idea that has been suggested many times over the past decade, including by former Chancellor and Health Secretary Sir Sajid Javid. A number of European nations have some form of charges, as do Australia and New Zealand. The argument put forward is that it would raise vital funds and - as Patricia argues - encourage more responsible use. But experts at the King's Fund think tank have argued that the cost of introducing the system coupled with the exemptions that would need to be put in place would mean the \"pain is not worth the limited gain\".\n\nChallenges remain\n\nThe government believes it has the right building blocks in place. Health Minister Stephen Kinnock says the steps being taken are having an effect, pointing out there are now more appointments being booked online than via phone for the first time. And, after years where the number of GPs has hardly risen despite increasing demand, he also says a relaxation in funding rules has led to an increase in GPs by 2,500 over the past year or so (although some of these are part-time). \"The tools and resources are there to deliver a modernised service fit for the future,\" adds Mr Kinnock. But this has not translated - at least yet - to a significant improvement in access. The most up-to-date polling is produced by the Office for National Statistics, which is carrying out monthly surveys on access to NHS care. It last asked people in late September and early October about their experience over the previous four weeks - this covered a period by which time GP numbers had gone up and when there was already significant access to online booking. While it only became mandatory to offer online booking on 1 October many practices had taken the step before then.",

    "text": "Surgical menopause like a 'hormonal cliff edge'\n\n22 hours ago Share Save Cash Murphy South East Share Save\n\nKate Dyson Kate Dyson started the campaign group Surge Menopause after her experiences with surgical menopause\n\nA woman who was plunged into sudden menopause after surgery to remove both ovaries is spearheading efforts to change NHS policy. Kate Dyson, 44, from Hastings, East Sussex, underwent the surgery six months ago after having a subtotal hysterectomy in 2021 to remove her uterus - a procedure which leaves the cervix in place. The mum-of-three says she was completely unprepared for the impact of surgical menopause, which is triggered by both ovaries being removed. \"Honestly, it was like falling off a hormonal cliff edge,\" she told BBC Radio Sussex.\n\n\"Within hours of the surgery I was home the same day. I was experiencing hot flushes, confusion, and the first night I woke up in the morning and I was absolutely dripping with sweat,\" she said. Ms Dyson found the aftercare galling, and said this was commonplace for women. \"We are discharged without hormones, without warning, and without support,\" she said. \"In my discharge notes it simply read, 'can try combined HRT [hormone replacement therapy] if she wishes', as if it were suggesting a glass of wine at the weekend.\" This experience prompted her to start campaign group Surge Menopause, whose aim is to push the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) to revolutionise its offering. The DHSC said it was taking action to combat deficiencies, including adding menopause advice to NHS health checks and bringing down gynecology waiting lists. A spokesperson said: \"It is unacceptable women are not receiving the proper care and support following surgical menopause and the Health Secretary has been clear that we inherited a broken NHS with too many women still subject to a system that doesn't listen to their experiences or understand their needs.\"\n\nMenopause 'one-stop shop'\n\nMs Dyson said: \"We're calling for every woman facing ovary removal to receive clear information about the impact of surgical menopause pre-surgery, supportive information about hormone therapy and automatic access to HRT where it's safe, and proper follow-up care that responds to the severity of symptoms experienced by women in surgical menopause.\" According to research by Newson Health and Dr Ceri Cashell, only 4.8% of 126 pre-menopausal women at three NHS hospitals who underwent surgery to remove both ovaries received HRT afterwards. This is despite the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) and British Menopause Society recommending HRT until the average age of natural menopause, around the age of 51. Ms Dyson built the Surge website herself in a bid to create a \"one-stop shop\" for all matters around surgical menopause. Her biggest objective was to create a space where those affected could learn what life looks like \"in this whole new chapter of surgical menopause\".\n\nFollow BBC Sussex on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

Sir Jim Mackey said there is \"no doubt\" this winter will be one of the toughest the health service has faced. It comes as flu rates have started climbing early this year, which is causing concern because the winter vaccination campaign has only just got under way and there are lots of vulnerable people yet to get protected. NHS England is issuing a \"flu jab SOS\", urging those eligible for the free vaccine to come forward quickly for it.\n\nMore than 13 million people have been vaccinated so far this year, but that is still more than 5 million below the number who were jabbed last winter. Sir Jim said: \"There's no doubt this winter will be one of the toughest our staff have ever faced. \"Since stepping into this role, the thought of a long, drawn-out flu season has kept me awake at night. And, unfortunately, it looks like that fear is becoming reality. \"Australia has just endured its worst flu season on record — over 410,000 cases — and all the signs suggest the NHS will face similar challenges in the months ahead. From December through to March, our hospitals will be at capacity.\"\n\nHow to get a flu shot\n\nPeople aged 65 and over, pregnant women and those with certain long-term health conditions can get a free flu jab on the NHS. Appointments can be booked online, by phoning 119 or at local pharmacies and GPs. Children aged two to 16 can also get vaccinated with a nasal spray. That's mainly to help stop flu spreading. Other people can buy a flu vaccine from high street chemist shops and some supermarket pharmacies.",

    "text": "Botox was like going for coffee - but I had no idea if it was genuine\n\n4 days ago Share Save Jenny Rees Wales health correspondent Share Save\n\nLizzie Day says it is easy to fall for the buzz around the latest treatment being talked about on TikTok or Instagram\n\nFor Lizzie Day, having Botox was as much a part of her routine as getting her morning coffee. It was only when a doctor friend raised concerns about a \"fat-dissolving\" treatment she was using that the 30-year-old took stock and started questioning what was going into her body. Until this point, the recruitment consultant admitted she would just \"jump on the bandwagon\" of the latest aesthetic treatment to be discussed on social media. Wales' regulator Healthcare Inspectorate Wales (HIW) believes a comprehensive review is required into the type of services available, as well as into who provides them and where. Its head Alun Jones said regulation has not kept up, creating \"loopholes and anomalies\", while one GP likened the current situation to a \"free-for-all\". The Welsh government said brands of botulinum toxin such as Botox and weight-loss medicines can only be supplied with a prescription and a scoping exercise will be carried out early next year to see if further regulation is needed.\n\nBotulinum toxin - commonly known by the brand name Botox - is also sold under several other licensed brands in the UK, including Azzalure, Bocouture and Dysport. \"I had no idea what was being injected into me,\" Lizzie said. \"It's just hype - it's a trend, a bit like fashion - if everyone buys the same handbag it becomes popular and I'd say it's the same for aesthetics.\"\n\nLizzie has become more aware of the lack of regulation surrounding many of the trending products\n\nIn England anyone prescribing anti-wrinkle or weight-loss injections Mounjaro and Ozempic must be registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC). However, in Wales only doctors are required to register with the Welsh equivalent, HIW. This means other healthcare professionals are not legally required to meet the same standards or be routinely inspected. Despite this, many do not question who carries out work, as Lizzie adds: \"It's just like going to get your coffee in the morning - popping in for a bit of Botox.\"\n\nDr Tom Kamal says the regulation of Botox and weight-loss injections in Wales should be tightened for patient safety\n\nLizzie has lived in Manchester for the past decade, where she said treatments such as fillers, jaw-line enhancement and laser treatment are the norm for many. It was only when a doctor friend back home in south Wales raised concerns about a \"fat-dissolving\" treatment she was using, that she took stock.\n\nShe now gets Botox treatment with a GP at a private clinic in the Vale of Glamorgan, where she will also have treatment declined if they don't think it's necessary - something she was not accustomed to elsewhere. \"I did beg him for Mounjaro,\" she laughed. \"But he said 'sorry, you don't qualify'. \"But I know some people who will get told no by one person and will go anywhere to get it.\"\n\nAlun Jones says loopholes have unintentionally been created within the existing legislation in Wales\n\nHIW's Alun Jones said a comprehensive review is required. \"If you're a non-clinical individual providing Botox injections, it's hard to see where the oversight comes from,\" he added. \"The legislation that empowers us to act is quite out of date.\" He said carrying out certain procedures requires HIW registration, but only if provided from a fixed, physical location. \"So you could provide certain services on a mobile basis and you would no longer need to be registered with us,\" Mr Jones added. He said monitoring and inspections would drive up standards or spot bad practice, which in turn would keep the public safe. \"What the public might not know is the person giving them an injection has had minimal training and perhaps they're not equipped to cope with a medical emergency should there be a reaction to that injection,\" he said.\n\nHannah Jones was alarmed to find out she shouldn't have been receiving botulinum toxin top-ups so regularly\n\nHannah Jones, from Cardiff, started using what she thought was Botox when she turned 30 last year. But she kept returning for top-ups every fortnight because it wasn't having the desired \"freezing\" effect. It was only when she came across contradictory advice from another provider online that she started questioning what was being injected into her face, as doses had never been discussed. She also learned she needed to wait 12 weeks between these injections, and prescribers of Botox had to see patients face-to-face, whereas she had only ever received injections from a third party, not the named prescriber of the medicine. \"That was a major red flag,\" she said. \"I think it's really important that people do their research before they have these treatments.\"\n\nDr Tom Kamal says patients tell him they have previously sourced weight-loss medication in unmarked vials. \"It's just liquid they're drawing up and injecting themselves - it could be anything.\"\n\nThese are issues the aesthetics industry itself has long campaigned to change, right across the UK, with a new bill drawn up earlier this year in Scotland. Dr Tom Kamal is a GP registrar in Barry, but also runs his own private clinic in the Vale of Glamorgan, where he provides aesthetic treatments such as Botox, as well as weight-loss injections - which can have severe side effects if not properly administered. He said he has treated many clients who had previously unnecessarily moved up through the doses of Mounjaro very quickly. \"Everyone seems to think that the higher the dose, the more rapid the weight loss is, but that's actually not the case - it's no wonder they experience side effects.\" He said under the right supervision the medicine \"can make a massive difference\" but the side effects can range from nausea, constipation and diarrhoea, to more sinister things such as pancreatitis and gallstones. Dr Kamal described the situation in Wales as \"a free-for-all\".\n\nLydia Cheetham said she was 14 or 15 when she first became interested in cosmetic treatments\n\nWith the non-surgical aesthetics industry estimated to be valued at £3bn, Dr Kamal said the challenge for regulators is keeping up with the pace of change in a sector driven by social media trends. \"Saying no is one of the most important things that we do here in clinic,\" he said, adding that it would be easy to capitalise on trends and provide unnecessary services for clients willing to pay. It's advice such as this that Lydia Cheetham from Penarth wishes she had been given eight years ago, when the trend was \"big lips, big bum, big cheeks - it was everything bigger\", she said. Lydia had her first lip fillers at 18, only to have them painfully dissolve a few years later. \"I wish I had never gone so crazy in the first place because I think I'm still living with the lasting effects around my mouth and I don't know if that'll ever go away fully,\" she said. \"I wish someone had just said 'look you do not need all this'. \"There needs to be much more regulation to stop people doing things just because it's trending this year or your friends have done it.\"",

Prosecutors alleged that the man, who has not been publicly named, injected his mostly elderly patients with painkillers or sedatives in an effort to ease his workload during shifts overnight. The offences were committed between December 2023 and May 2024 in a hospital in Wuerselen, in western Germany. Investigators are reported to be looking into several other suspicious cases during his career.\n\nAccording to media outlet Agence France-Presse (AFP), the unnamed man had been employed at the hospital in Wuerselen since 2020, after completing training as a nursing professional in 2007. Prosecutors told a court in Aachen that he showed \"irritation\" and a lack of empathy to patients who required a higher level of care, and accused him of playing \"master of life and death\". The court was told that he injected patients with large doses of morphine and midazolam, a type of sedative, in an effort to reduce his workload during night shifts. He was arrested in 2024.\n\nWhen issuing the life sentence, the court said that the man's crimes carried a \"particular severity of guilt\" which should bar him from early release after 15 years. He will be able to appeal the verdict. Prosecutors have told AFP that exhumations are taking place to identify further potential victims, which could see the man put on trial again.",

    "text": "How caffeine can help you manage headaches and other tips\n\n5 days ago Share Save Yasmin Rufo and Michelle Roberts Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nHeadaches are something almost all of us deal with at some point. They can last from a couple of minutes to days and the pain can be sharp, dull, throbbing or stabbing and sometimes spread beyond your head to your scalp, face or even your neck. Dr Xand van Tulleken, who hosts the BBC's What's Up Docs wellness podcast, knows the feeling all too well and says he gets headaches once a month or every six weeks and it \"feels like someone's drilling into my eyeball\". While it's easy to panic about what might be behind a bad headache, Dr Katy Munro, a GP and expert at the National Migraine Centre, says it's rarely something serious. \"It's natural to worry that something is seriously wrong, but the chances of that are actually very small,\" she explains. She advises that if it's your \"first or worst headache, get it checked out by a doctor,\" but if you're getting a pattern of milder, recurring headaches, there are a few simple things you can try at home as well as seeing your GP.\n\n1. How big was the impact on your day?\n\nDr Xand says understanding your own headaches can be surprisingly helpful as they often don't have a single cause so keeping a diary can help you spot patterns and triggers. For some people, weather such as thunder and lightning could trigger it, while for others it might be sensitivity to light. \"The worst time for me is when we're driving in the autumn and the sun is low and the sun is flickering through the trees...it really aggravates,\" says Dr Munro. It's worth noting down things like: What you were doing when the headache started\n\nWhat you ate or drank\n\nHow well you slept\n\nThe weather\n\nFor women, track your menstrual cycle, as headaches can be linked to hormonal changes But, Dr Munro cautions that you shouldn't overdo it. \"I made the mistake of making mine very detailed, which was depressing. Instead keep it simple and maybe write a number from one to 10 to summarise the impact it had on your day. \"It's also useful to track how many crystal-clear days you have, not just the bad ones. Your doctor can then review it to help identify patterns.\n\n2. Use caffeine wisely\n\nYou might think that caffeine is something you should instantly avoid if you have a headache but Dr Munro says the truth is more nuanced. In small, careful doses, it can make painkillers more effective if you are not having too much caffeine on a daily basis. \"Caffeine is a co-analgesic which means it can boost the effect of a painkiller,\" Dr Munro explains, but avoid it in the afternoon and evening as it can disrupt your sleep. It's worth also thinking about your caffeine consumption more broadly - consuming lots of it every day can cause a caffeine overuse headache and if you suddenly stop, you might get a withdrawal headache.\n\n3. Don't skip meals\n\nWhat you eat and when may make a difference if you're suffering from headaches. Dr Munro recommends following a diet similar to the Mediterranean one that is rich in protein, healthy fats and complex carbs which can help stabilise your energy levels. You should avoid quick-release sugary snacks and definitely don't skip meals as that can be a common trigger. Dr Munro says she found her headaches were helped by cutting out dairy and gluten, though that's not universal. \"I also found eating regularly and taking lunch to work made a difference,\" she says. As well as thinking about food, Dr Munro says regular exercise, good sleep, stress management and staying hydrated can also help reduce headaches. You should drink enough during the day so your pee is a pale clear colour and you don't feel thirsty.\n\n4. Avoid painkillers with codeine\n\n\"There are lots of things, like painkillers or anti-nausea tablets, you can buy over the counter that may be helpful to manage headaches\" says Dr Munro. She cautions that you should avoid \"anything containing codeine\" as it can make some headaches occur more frequently and can worsen symptoms like nausea. \"Painkillers can work extremely well but it does depend on how severe your headache is. \"If they're becoming more frequent or intense, your GP can help you find a more suitable medication.\" Make sure you don't regularly take painkillers on more than two days a week as this will reduce your risk of rebound headaches.",

    "text": "Vapers overtake smokers for first time in Britain\n\n7 days ago Share Save Philippa Roxby Health reporter Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nFor the first time in Great Britain, there are more over-16s using vapes or e-cigarettes than smoking cigarettes, according to the Office for National Statistics. Some 5.4 million adults use vapes daily or occasionally, compared with 4.9 million using cigarettes, an ONS survey for 2024 suggests. Daily use of vapes is most common among 25-49 year olds, with rising use among women. The popularity of cigarette smoking has been falling for the past decade as the harmful effects of tobacco encouraged many to quit, while less risky vape use has been rising - particularly among younger age groups.\n\nVaping poses a small fraction of the risks of smoking, the NHS says, since cigarettes release thousands of chemicals when they burn, many of which are poisonous and can cause cancer. Switching to vaping reduces those risks but the long-term effects of vaping aren't yet known. Health experts say vaping is not competely harmless, so children and non-smokers should never vape. The charity Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) said the drop in smoking was \"good news for public health\" but warned that those still smoking \"are trapped in a cycle of addiction that will likely take their lives\". ASH says smoking is responsible for 70,000 deaths every year and is the leading cause of preventable death in the UK. It is urging the government to invest in and support communities where smoking rates remain high. The ONS's Opinions and Lifestyle Survey suggests that 10% of adults aged 16 and over currently use an e-cigarette every day or occasionally - slightly more than the 9.1% who say they currently smoke. The number saying they've given up smoking has risen - 74.2% in 2024, up from 70.3% in 2023. Back in the 1970s, less than 30% had quit the habit. At that time, nearly half of the population were smokers. But much has changed since then. In 2006-2007, a ban on smoking in enclosed public places and workplaces was introduced and in 2015, a ban on smoking in cars with children was brought in. More recently in 2017, plain cigarette packaging was introduced. And government legislation currently progressing through parliament - called the Tobacco and Vapes Bill - will soon mean anyone born on or after 1 January 2009 will not be legally allowed to buy tobacco in the UK.\n\n'Keep young people safe'",

    "text": "BMA rejects fresh offer to end doctor strikes\n\n5 days ago Share Save Nick Triggle Health correspondent Share Save\n\nPress Association\n\nThe British Medical Association has rejected a fresh offer from the government to end the long-running dispute with resident doctors in England. Health Secretary Wes Streeting had proposed covering the cost of exam fees and expanding training places more quickly than planned and wrote to the union on Wednesday giving it until the end of Thursday to accept the package. But the BMA said the offer did not go far enough - and the government needed to increase pay. It comes ahead of a five-day strike by resident doctors, the name now for junior doctors, which gets under way on 14 November. It will be the 13th walkout since March 2023.\n\nThe fresh offer made by Streeting in the letter to the BMA on Wednesday afternoon followed a meeting with the union's leaders on Tuesday. There were a range of measures, including covering the cost of mandatory exams, which can run to thousands of pounds over the course of doctor training, and membership fees to royal colleges. The health secretary had also promised to expand the number of training places more quickly than initially planned. But the BMA told the BBC on Wednesday night that it had rejected the offer. The 10-year NHS plan published in early summer pledged an extra 1,000 training places by 2028, but this will now be increased to 2,000 with the 1,000 boost happening next year. These are speciality training places that doctors move into after the first two years of training. This year there were more than 30,000 applicants for 10,000 jobs at this stage, although some will have been doctors from abroad.\n\nSignificant disruption",

    "text": "Woman 'strung along' seriously ill man over kidney donation\n\n5 days ago Share Save Lyndsey Telford BBC News NI Share Save\n\nBBC Nicola Hutton contacted Billy Cullen, who was in need of a kidney transplant, following an appeal for a donor\n\nA Belfast woman who \"strung along\" a seriously ill man with lies that she would donate her kidney to him has been branded \"callous\" and \"not human\". On Thursday, Nicola Hutton, from Strandburn Drive, was sentenced to five months in prison after being convicted of a false communication offence. The 54-year-old had contacted Billy Cullen, who was in need of a kidney transplant, and his wife Joanne following their appeal for a donor. Mrs Cullen told BBC News NI they believed Hutton was an \"angel\" who would save her husband's life.\n\n\"She said: 'I'm a match, everything's fine',\" Mrs Cullen said. \"And we just thought this woman's an angel. She's come into our lives, she's going to save my husband's life. And at this stage Billy couldn't work any longer because he was just rapidly deteriorating. Things got on their way and as far as we were concerned Nicola was going to be our donor.\"\n\nJoanne Cullen says her family's world 'came crashing down'\n\nHutton told the pair that she was attending appointments and having tests carried out, and that the operation would be performed within months. The court heard how Hutton also met with the couple, who gave her a Marc Jacobs gift set as a gesture of thanks. Mrs Cullen said: \"Then one day we got a phone call from the kidney team saying, 'There's no more we can do for you Billy'. We said, 'No, no, we have a donor'. \"We were told, 'No you don't have a donor. The kidney team did their own investigations and found this woman had never applied to be a donor. She had never so much as sent off a form or a phone call.\" She said the family's \"world came crashing down\".\n\n'Emotional parasite'\n\nHutton appeared before Belfast Magistrates' Court for sentencing on Thursday, where District Judge Francis Rafferty described her act as one of \"abject wickedness\". He said she was an \"emotional parasite\" who fed off the couple's despair and \"luxuriated\" in offering them false hope. \"You presented yourself as an angel or a saviour and took the kudos and credit for that when you knew that you were as malignant a process in their life as any illness or sickness,\" the judge said. \"Your repugnant, repellent behaviour was exacerbated by the fact that you maintained your catalogue of lies and evasions, you required a member of the transplant team to take themselves away from the work they do, to sit in court and listen to you lie about them, their procedures and their professionalism,\" he added. \"At a time when the family were facing the gravest threat of all, the loss of a husband and a father, you decided to inject yourself into their world and spread poison, wickedness and false hope. \"A search process that exasperated the family, that caused them waking torment.\"\n\nBilly Cullen and his wife Joanne and daughter Grace\n\nHe set out how the couple had called off their search for a donor, overjoyed when Hutton informed them she was a match and offering \"not just respite but rescue\". \"A family saw you as their saviour and then (their) world stopped whenever your lies and your wicked machinations were exposed,\" the judge stated. \"I can only imagine the abject horror they felt whenever they realised that you had been lying to them all along.\" The court heard that while Mr Cullen has since received a kidney from a legitimate donor, the six months wasted believing that Hutton was a donor could have had the most serious physical consequence.\n\n'You lied repeatedly'\n\nMrs Cullen told the BBC that when the family first appealed for a donor in summer 2024, her husband's kidney function was at 15 per cent. She said by the time Nicola had \"strung us along for six months\", his function had dropped to nine and 10 per cent. \"He then had to have surgery to have dialysis tubes put in and he then had to commence dialysis,\" she said. \"He went through an awful lot of emotions. It wasn't just the fact that she did it to us, it was just why? We just don't understand, still don't understand what she could possibly get out of this. The search should have continued and would have continued if I did not believe this woman's callous lies.\"\n\n'I cannot imagine a more cruel act'",

    "text": "LED mask ads banned over acne and rosacea claims\n\n5 days ago Share Save Jennifer Meierhans Business reporter Share Save\n\nGetty Images Adverts for LED masks that are not registered with the medicines regulator have been banned (stock photo)\n\nA number of adverts for LED face masks have been banned for making unauthorised claims they can improve acne and rosacea. The popularity of at-home beauty devices has surged in recent years with social media feeds filled with influencers unboxing and reviewing the masks as the latest skincare trend. However, dermatologists are divided over whether light-emitting diodes (LED) in at-home masks can deliver the results of medical-grade devices used in clinics. The advertising watchdog banned adverts for cosmetic devices which were not registered with the medicines regulator.\n\nLED therapy is thought to stimulate cells and improve the skin, but devices must be registered with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to make medical claims about skin conditions like acne and rosacea. Devices registered with the MHRA can be searched on its Public Access Registration Database (PARD). But the MHRA told the BBC \"there are currently no LED face masks currently registered.\" Dermatologists have previously told the BBC there have not been clinical trials with large enough sample sizes for long enough periods of time to know the benefits of at-home LED masks. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) used AI to search for ads which might break the rules, and the bans followed that search.\n\n'My acne had disappeared'\n\nAn advert on Project E Beauty's website showed before and after images of a woman's forehead with and without acne, with the words: \"By week three, my acne had disappeared\". The ad stated: \"Our most advanced LED mask for deeper skin renewal\". It claimed it \"treats acne\" and offered \"83% improvement in acne lesions in four weeks\". The ASA said \"no medical claims could be made for the product, whether or not such claims appeared in customer testimonials.\" Project E Beauty LLC said it had removed potential medical claims relating to \"healing\", \"treating acne\" and \"rosacea\". It also said it had amended the advert to state that any references to acne in before/after photos and reviews were testimonials based on personal experiences.\n\nSilk'n This advert was banned for making a medicinal claim about acne\n\nA paid-for social media ad for Silk'n featured a video of a woman using an LED face mask with the caption: \"Finished with the blue light to help treat my acne and scars\". Invention Works BV, trading as Silk'n, acknowledged the term \"acne\" constituted a medical claim. It said the advert was created by a woman after prolonged use of the mask and the wording reflected her individual perception and results. The ASA told Silk'n the adverts must not appear again in that form.\n\nBeautaholics Beautaholics agreed not to make claims about acne in adverts in future\n\nOther adverts banned include one on the Beautaholics website for a RejuvaLux mask which stated: \"This mask provides targeted solutions for...acne...rosacea.\" Beautaholics said it would not make claims regarding the treatment or prevention of medical conditions in future. A paid-for social media ad for a mask by Luyors Retail Inc was also banned after it stated: \"It helps tackle everything from acne...with clinical precision.\" Luyors said it would ensure future advertising did not refer to \"acne\" or other terms that could imply a medicinal claim.",

    "text": "Calls for legal right to paid leave for IVF treatment\n\n7 days ago Share Save Georgia Roberts Political Correspondent Share Save\n\nSUPPLIED Natalie Rowntree says both she and her husband have been using sick days to attend IVF appointments\n\nNatalie Rowntree from North Yorkshire has recently started her IVF journey, and describes the process as \"intense\". The 38-year-old has had seven IVF-related appointments in the space of eight weeks, including multiple blood tests, scans and X-rays, one of which left her in physical discomfort for \"a good few days\". As is the nature of fertility treatment, all of these appointments have to be done at very specific times of the month - and fitting this around her job at a private opticians has proven difficult. \"I've just been using sick days and holidays to go through these appointments,\" she says.\n\nAdded to this is the emotional toll of having to manage the process, with no entitlement to time off. Two years ago, Natalie had two miscarriages over a six month period and since then has not been able to conceive with her partner. \"The emotion side is quite difficult, and then trying to manage that around work...do I bite the bullet and explain what's happening? Or keep having sick days and holidays?\" she says.\n\nAccording to research from the social enterprise Fertility Matters at Work, Natalie is one of the around 63% of employees undergoing IVF who are taking sick leave to undergo treatment - with most citing they were doing so to hide their treatment from their employer. Now there are calls for women undergoing fertility treatments to have the legal right to paid time off to attend their appointments. Campaigners claim that while some employers offer fertility support, it is unequal and not guaranteed, and should be classed as a medical procedure. Becoming pregnant through IVF enables the same maternity rights as non-IVF pregnancies, but currently in employment law there are no legal rights when it comes to fertility treatment. According to Fertility Matters at Work's research, that comes at a potential cost of millions to the economy and businesses in lost productivity.\n\nNatalie says she has avoided bringing her treatment up with her managers because she is nervous about the reception she might get for taking time off work to go through the process. \"If I was to go to my managers and say I was pregnant, I wouldn't feel nervous at all about that...but with this, because you don't know how long it's going to go on for, you can't give work a timescale.\" Employment guidance from the Equality and Human Rights Commission advises \"good practice\" to employers with workers seeking leave for IVF treatment, but it acknowledges that such requests are not covered by the protected characteristic of pregnancy and maternity in law. However, refusing to grant someone leave for fertility treatment could count as sex discrimination in certain situations - but campaigners say this is hard to prove.\n\n'Employers could benefit too'\n\nBecky Kearns, from Fertility Matters at Work, co-founded the group with two other women after they all experienced their own difficulties undergoing IVF whilst trying to keep afloat in the workplace. The 39-year-old says providing time off would be a potential benefit of employers, who could save the economy millions in lost productivity. \"What we're finding is, because there's 63% taking sick leave, that is having an impact on businesses, there's a cost for the disruption of this absence.\" She also thinks employers need to be more aware of the toll IVF - which she considers a \"significant life event\" - can take on their employees. \"You often have a number of very short notice appointments you have to attend, it's very dependent on how your body is responding to medication. \"But we also know there's still a huge amount of stigma that surrounds IVF and infertility. \"We receive messages almost daily from people who are struggling with this experience...people taking sick leave to hide treatment, the fact that they're then triggered on absence procedures and potentially having their performance monitored. \"And it was all because they were going through fertility treatment and just felt unable to say that was what they were going through.\" She says women have also told them they have left jobs and signed non-disclosure agreements as a result of going through IVF.\n\nEMOTIVE EYE Becky Kearns also struggled while undergoing fertility treatment\n\nThe government says that while no specific legal right to time off for IVF treatment exists, it expects employers to treat staff fairly and accommodate reasonable requests. The government also says it is strengthening flexible working rules which will make it easier for employees to agree arrangements with their workplace for support. But that isn't enough reassurance for the Labour MP Alice MacDonald, who will be introducing the issue in Parliament via a ten minute rule bill, which proposes to put into law the legal right to time off for fertility appointments.\n\nLabour MP Alice MacDonald says her bill would introduce fairness into the workplace\n\nWhilst it is unlikely the issue becomes law without official government backing, she is seeking to get it \"firmly on the government's radar\". \"Many people, especially women, are impacted by this when you're trying to have a baby and through no fault of your own, you need that extra medical support, you don't have a right to time off to go to those appointments,\" she says. \"At a time when you are hoping that it's going to work, hoping it's going to be successful, finally be pregnant and have the baby you've wanted you've got another additional barrier which is with your employer. \"There are many employers who are supportive but you have to hope you've got one that understands and who will give you the time off. \"If it was clearly in law what your rights are we think it opens up that conversation and employers would have to have a policy.\"\n\n'Striking a balance'\n\nPatrick Milnes from the British Chambers of Commerce says there is a concern amongst businesses about the potential for \"over legislation\" in anticipation of the Employment Rights Bill in particular, which will seek to ease rules on flexible working. \"Small and medium businesses in particular have been talking to us about how concerned they are about navigating different types of legislative leave,\" he says. \"Most employers that we speak to are doing this kind of thing anyway as a matter of good practice. \"If you legislate, those processes can become more complicated it can become more burdensome, and actually in many instances it's easier to do these things on a case by case, ad hoc basis. \"There's a middle ground between having nothing at all and having a full legislated process that might be overwhelming in some instances.\"",

    "text": "Widower backs new pancreatic cancer breath trial\n\n29 October 2025 Share Save Chloe Hughes West Midlands Share Save\n\nAndrew Palmer Andrew Palmer's wife Jen died a month after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer\n\nA man whose wife died from pancreatic cancer is backing a new clinical trial into breath tests which could help detect the disease. Andrew Palmer's wife Jen, 50, was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in February 2024 and died a month later. Pancreatic Cancer UK has invested more than £1.1m, to develop the test into a study. It finds volatile organic compounds in the breath, detectable in cancer patients even at the early stages of disease, it said. \"If there had been a breath test, perhaps that would have been performed when she first presented with symptoms - she may have been eligible for treatment, at least giving her more time,\" said Mr Palmer, 55, of Oswestry, Shropshire.\n\n\"Jen thought she had time and had planned things to do for the kids. We had no idea how little time we had left with her.\" No screening or early detection tests exist for pancreatic cancer.\n\nAndrew Palmer Andrew Palmer said a breath test at the start of his wife Jen's symptoms may have meant she was eligible for treatment\n\n\"Jen had so many different tests: blood tests, scans, endoscopies, but it didn't pick up the cancer,\" Mr Palmer said. \"She was diagnosed too late and was too physically weak for chemotherapy to have given her more time. \"The brutality of the disease can't be understated, there are no options at late stages - there must be hope for those who will go through this in the future.\" The money invested by Pancreatic Cancer UK will see the test become a multi-centre validation study, and will then seek adoption by the NHS. Patients would be recruited from the NHS Urgent Suspected Cancer Pathway – under which patients should receive an appointment within two weeks of a GP referral. The trial would involve more than 6,000 patients with an unknown diagnosis, and would see about 40 trial sites set up at hospitals across England, Scotland and Wales.\n\nJeff Moore The test detects volatile organic compounds in the breath, which scientists say are detectable in cancer patients even at the early stages of disease\n\nSuzanne, a former theatre nurse from York, was diagnosed with the disease in September 2023, but was eligible for surgery. She said she wanted to underline the difference an early diagnosis makes and hoped that in future, the test could save thousands of other families the pain of losing a loved one. \"I have no doubt that if my doctor hadn't taken note of my symptoms and referred me to the hospital where I was quickly sent for a CT scan, things would have been different,\" she said. Louise Dale from Gresford in Wrexham lost her mum 12 weeks after she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. She hopes the test can save others. \"We were heartbroken and angry that it had been left so long. From then, Mum went downhill very quickly,\" she said. \"On top of her existing symptoms, she suffered from diarrhoea and horrendous nausea... she couldn't even bear to sit upright. It was truly horrendous.\" Diana Jupp, CEO of Pancreatic Cancer UK, said the breath test had the potential to revolutionise the early detection of pancreatic cancer. \"It is, undoubtedly, the most significant step toward a lifesaving breakthrough in 50 years,\" she said.\n\nFollow BBC Shropshire on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.",

    "text": "Skip short strolls – a longer daily walk is better for your heart, says study\n\n27 October 2025 Share Save Michelle Roberts Digital health editor Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nOne longer walk a day is better for your heart than lots of short strolls, especially if you don't exercise much, according to new research published in Annals of Internal Medicine. Walking for at least 15 minutes without stopping is ideal, it says. That's about 1,500 steps in a row, which gives your heart a good workout. Many people aim for 10,000 steps a day, but that number came from a Japanese pedometer advertisement - not science. Still, experts agree more steps are generally better for your health. The study looked at 33,560 adults aged 40–79 in the UK who walked fewer than 8,000 steps a day.\n\nThey were grouped by how long their walks were (measured with a step-counter over a week): less than 5 minutes (43%)\n\n5 to 10 minutes (33.5%)\n\n10 to 15 minutes (15.5%)\n\n15 minutes or more (8%) The researchers, from the University of Sydney and the Universidad Europea in Spain, tracked their health over eight years. People who walked in longer stretches had a lower risk of heart problems than those who walked in short bursts. Even among the least active - those walking under 5,000 steps a day - longer walks made a big difference. Their risk of heart disease and death dropped significantly. Whether that's because they were fitter to begin with isn't fully clear from the study, but the researchers did try to control for this by taking into account factors like whether the person smoked, was obese or had high cholesterol.\n\nFocus on how you walk – not just how much\n\nThe researchers say how you walk matters - not just how much. Walking for longer at a time, even if you don't walk much overall, appears to help your heart. Simple changes, like setting aside time for a longer walk, could make a big difference, they suggest. Co-lead researcher Prof Emmanuel Stamatakis said: \"We tend to place all the emphasis on the number of steps or the total amount of walking but neglect the crucial role of patterns, for example 'how' walking is done. \"This study shows that even people who are very physically inactive can maximise their heart health benefit by tweaking their walking patterns to walk for longer at a time, ideally for at least 10-15 minutes, when possible.\" Prof Kevin McConway, emeritus professor of applied statistics at the Open University, said while the study shows a link between walking and better heart health, it doesn't prove that walking directly causes the improvement. The NHS recommends 150 minutes of moderate activity a week, like brisk walking, ideally spread out evenly across the week. Older adults over 65 should try to move every day, even if it's just light activity around the house, the advice says. Emily McGrath, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: \"Exercise helps everyone live a happier and healthier life. If you have heart and circulatory disease, it can help you manage your condition and make you feel better overall. \"You may find it hard to be more active at first, but as time goes on it'll get easier as your body gets used to the activity. You may only notice small improvements at first, but it all adds up and counts towards keeping your heart healthy.\"\n\nHow to stay safe while walking\n\nIf you are walking or cycling at night or in low light conditions, wear reflective clothing or use a flashlight or headlamp to increase your visibility to other road users. Stay alert and be aware of your surroundings. Use designated lanes or paths, if available. Always cross at designated crossing points where road traffic is more likely to see and expect you to be crossing the road.",

Mabel Williams suffered fatal brain injuries after her mum, Becky Williams, had an undiagnosed uterine rupture during labour at Great Western Hospital, Swindon, in September 2023. Mrs Williams chose a vaginal birth for Mabel, after having a C-section for a previous child, but was not warned by the hospital of the potentially life-threatening risks for both of them if her uterus ruptured, an inquest heard in August. \"If those words 'it can be fatal' had been said to me, I'd never have risked my daughter's life. That simple truth could have saved Mabel,\" Mrs Williams said.\n\nFamily handout Mabel died from brain injuries caused by a lack of oxygen during birth\n\nIn the inquest in August, the coroner ruled neglect contributed to Mabel's death, and was preventable, and warned pregnant women are not being warned enough of the fatal risks of vaginal birth after C-section (VBAC). The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said it is updating a VBAC information leaflet, which is used by hospital trusts in the UK, to include information on the risks of uterine rupture after the coroner said there was a \"lack of clarity\". Great Western Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the hospital, said it will provide better access to information for parents \"to support them to make informed decisions about their birth choices\". The coroner, Robert Sowersby, produced two prevention of future deaths reports in the September for the hospital and the Royal College to address their recommendations. The Royal College said it has responded to Mr Sowersby and the trust, which has until 5 November to reply.\n\nFamily handout Mrs Williams chose VBAC because hospital staff told her it was \"low risk\"\n\nSince Mabel died on 10 September 2023 in Bristol Children's Hospital, Mrs Williams said she has spoken to dozens of mums who have experienced similar cases and wants to make sure it \"never happens again\". \"Mabel's life was short, but her impact can be lasting,\" she said. Mrs Williams said she was anxious about giving birth to Mabel, and chose to have a VBAC because hospital staff said there was \"low risk\". \"We live every day knowing that Mabel should be here. We did everything we could to protect her,\" she said. \"We asked the questions, I voiced my fears. But the truth was hidden in medical language that made it sound safe. \"We trusted the professionals. \"But the information we were given was incomplete, and the warning signs during labour were missed. \"Mabel's death was preventable. I was never told that a uterine rupture could kill my baby or be potentially fatal for me too.\" The 35-year-old said she wants to push for safer maternity care for women. \"I think it's incredible that whilst we might have lost our little girl, potentially we, through the coroner, have saved some other families from going through what we have to go through. \"Which for me is like a little legacy for Mabel.\"\n\nMabel's family had one day to see her in hospital when she was alive\n\nThe coroner also said midwives \"failed to recognise numerous indicators of Mabel's distress, and of the increasing severity of Becky's clinical condition, and convey them to the clinical team\". Her husband and Mabel's father, Tom Williams, said Mabel's six days alive were \"the hardest thing anyone could ever go through\". \"We had one day to allow family to come and meet her, spend some time with her and read stories,\" he said. \"Just like our parents get to meet their granddaughter, and that was it. Just one day of that.\"\n\nHospital has 'learnt lessons'\n\nA Great Western Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust spokesperson said it is \"truly sorry that Mabel and her mother were not given the level of personalised, compassionate, and safe care that was needed\". They added they have \"learnt lessons\" and \"acted\" on concerns raised by the couple and the coroner. Professor Ranee Thakar, president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: \"It's essential that maternity teams support women to make informed choices about how to give birth, including ensuring that risks and benefits of different modes of birth are fully discussed throughout their pregnancy. \"Our clinical guidelines, consent advice, patient information, alongside our training and education programmes, are all designed to support maternity teams to do this well. \"We follow a robust process to develop these, with clinical and public involvement.\" A spokesperson for the Royal College said anyone with concerns should \"contact their healthcare team who will be able to give advice while taking into consideration their individual medical history\".",

    "text": "News outlets will not be allowed to broadcast former President Donald Trump’s arraignment on Tuesday in a New York state court, a judge said Monday night, but he will allow some photographers to take pictures in the courtroom before the proceedings formally begin.\n\nActing New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan rejected the request by several media organizations, including CNN, for permission to broadcast the historic proceedings. Trump’s arraignment — like most arraignments in the Manhattan courthouse — is a public proceeding, but news cameras are not usually allowed to broadcast from inside the courtroom.\n\nHowever, the judge is allowing five pool photographers to take still photos at the beginning of the proceedings “until such time as they are directed to vacate the jury box by court personnel.”\n\nEarlier on Monday, Trump’s lawyers urged the judge to reject the media’s request for live cameras in the courtroom. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office told the judge they didn’t have a position.\n\nThe media outlets that tried to get cameras into the courtroom argued that “the gravity of this proceeding … and, consequently, the need for the broadest possible public access, cannot be overstated.”\n\nTrump is now in Manhattan ahead of the arraignment. A grand jury indicted the former president last week.\n\nThe arraignment is also expected to bring the unsealing of the criminal charges against Trump, which have not yet been seen by his lawyers or the public.\n\nThe indictment stems from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s investigation into hush-money payments, made during the 2016 presidential campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies.\n\nTrump denies all wrongdoing and his lawyers said last week that they’ll fight to get the charges dropped.",

    "text": "A Ukrainian tank is seen near the frontline area amid the Russia-Ukraine war, in Bakhmut, Ukraine, on April 02. (Muhammed Enes Yildirim/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)\n\nThe Ukrainian military has reported little change to the front lines but heavy fire from Russian forces at various parts of the front line in the Donetsk region.\n\nThe General Staff said that more than 45 enemy attacks had been repelled over the past day, with the focus on Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Mariinka.\n\nIt said there were 17 air strikes and more than 20 strikes by multiple launch rocket systems.\n\n“In the Bakhmut direction, the enemy is trying to take full control over the city of Bakhmut and continues to storm it,” the General Staff said.\n\nWest of the city, Ukrainian defense forces repelled about 20 enemy attacks, according to the General Staff.\n\nOleksandr Syrskyi, commander of Ukrainian Land Forces, posted on Telegram that in Bakhmut he had met with “soldiers and commanders who destroyed the myth of invincibility of the Wagner fighters and Russian paratroopers.”\n\n“The enemy is weakening and trying to cover up its failures with new fakes about the capture of Bakhmut,” Syrskyi said.\n\nSyrskyi referenced the possibility of a future counter-offensive, saying that “the forward movement of our entire army depends on what every soldier is doing right now on their section of the front.”\n\nSome of the most intense fighting is to the northwest and west of the city of Donetsk – as the Russians continue months-long efforts to dislodge Ukrainian defenses in Avdiivka and Mariinka. The General Staff said that some 20 assaults had been repelled.\n\n“There are also some operational successes of our military in the Donetsk area. Our military have taken some positions. They have taken a more strategic and favourable position,” said Oleksii Dmytrashkivskyi, spokesperson for the military in that zone.\n\nHe also noted that Russian special forces had been introduced in the area.\n\n“The enemy is trying to attack our positions between Avdiivka and Marinka. These attempts do not stop. It should be noted that the enemy has suffered quite significant losses,” Dmytrashkivskyi said.\n\nHe also claimed that the Russians “don’t have the same amount of equipment and, as they themselves say, they are on a ‘diet’ of ammunition for assaults.”\n\nSocial media video showed both sides engaged in heavy fire in the Avdiivka area, which the Russians have surrounded on three sides.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the leader of the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic, claimed that Russian forces were still advancing in the Avdiivka direction.\n\n“It is still premature to speak of encirclement, but the situation is being created, if not critical, then extremely difficult for the enemy… After clearing Kamianka, our units are moving further. There are difficulties both with the terrain, which must also be overcome, and there are also similarities with weather conditions. But these difficulties are mutual — both for the enemy and for us,” Pushilin said.",

    "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe Chinese spy balloon that transited the US earlier this year was able to capture imagery and collect some signals intelligence from US military sites, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.\n\nThe balloon was able to transmit information back to Beijing in real time, the source said, and the US government still does not know for sure whether the Chinese government could wipe the balloon’s data as it received it. That raises questions about whether there is intelligence the balloon was able to gather that the US still doesn’t know about.\n\nStill, the intelligence community has not been overly concerned about the information the balloon was able to gather, the person said, because it is not much more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to glean as they orbit over similar locations.\n\nA US intelligence official told CNN on Monday that “although analysis of the wreckage of the High Altitude Balloon remains ongoing, thus far, its flight over the United States does not appear to have provided critical new insights to the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nThe US also knew what the balloon’s path would be and was able to protect sensitive sites and censor some signals before the balloon was able to pick them up, officials have said.\n\nAs CNN has reported, the US intelligence community last year developed a method of tracking what it says is a fleet of these Chinese balloons operating across the globe, controlled by the Chinese military.\n\nThe FBI is still examining the balloon, but so far officials have been able to glean additional information about how the device worked, including the algorithms used for the balloon’s software and how it is powered and designed.\n\nCNN has reached out to the National Security Council at the White House and the Pentagon for comment. NBC was first to report on the new intelligence.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33 • Source: CNN Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33\n\nThe balloon first crossed into US airspace over Alaska in late January before passing through Canada and down into Montana, where it hovered for a few days, leading the US to believe it was trying to surveil sensitive military sites, like Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. It was eventually shot down by the US off the East Coast on February 4, and the incident further escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing, including the postponement of a diplomatic visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China.\n\nA senior State Department official said in February that, as the balloon floated across the US, it “was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.”\n\nGen. Glen VanHerck, the commander of US Northern Command and NORAD, said at the time that the US “did not assess” that the balloon “presented a significant collection hazard beyond what already exists in actionable technical means from the Chinese.”\n\nThe surveillance program, which includes a number of similar balloons, is in part run out of the small Chinese province of Hainan, officials told CNN. The US does not know the precise size of the fleet of Chinese surveillance balloons, but sources tell CNN that the program has conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years.\n\nRoughly half a dozen of those flights have been within US airspace, although not necessarily over US territory, according to one official familiar with the intelligence.\n\nChina has maintained that the balloon was actually just a weather balloon thrown off course, and the US has been assessing the possibility that it was not deliberately maneuvered into the continental US by the Chinese government, CNN has reported.\n\nStill, China did maintain some ability to maneuver the balloon, officials believe. And once the balloon was over Montana, China appeared to take advantage of its position to loiter over sensitive sites and try to collect intelligence.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.",

    "text": "Hong Kong CNN —\n\nAn anticipated meeting between Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen and US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in California this week has sparked concerns of a repeat of the pressure campaign China launched last year when then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taipei.\n\nAt that time, Beijing encircled the island democracy with unprecedented military drills – firing multiple missiles into its surrounding waters and sending dozens of warplanes speeding across a sensitive median line dividing the Taiwan Strait.\n\nIt also cut off contact with the United States over a number of issues from military matters to combating climate change, in retaliation for what it viewed as a violation of its sovereignty.\n\nThis time, Beijing has already threatened to “resolutely fight back” if a Tsai-McCarthy meeting goes ahead.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback See why tensions are rising between US and China over Taiwan 02:32 • Source: CNN See why tensions are rising between US and China over Taiwan 02:32\n\nIt also slammed Washington for allowing Tsai to stopover in the US while en route to and from official visits in Central America, warning it could lead to “serious” confrontation between the two powers.\n\nA defiant Tsai staked out her own ground, pledging as she took off on her 10-day trip not to let “external pressure” stop Taiwan from connecting with the world and like-minded democracies.\n\nBut the optics of the meeting, taking place in California and not Taiwan, and its timing – at a particularly thorny moment in China’s foreign relations and ahead of a presidential election in Taiwan that could reset the tone of its relationship with Beijing – may see Beijing tread more carefully this time, or at least not escalate further, analysts say.\n\n“This puts the burden on China not to overreact, because any overreaction is only going to push China further away from the world,” said Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Stimson Center think tank in Washington.\n\nThat doesn’t mean, however, that Beijing won’t be closely watching Tsai’s movements as it calibrates its response – and decides how much military might to flex over her meeting with an American lawmaker on American soil.\n\nThe opacity of China’s system – and the potential for competing interests within its vast bureaucracy – also make it difficult to accurately predict its response.\n\n“Every time Taiwan does anything that China doesn’t like, the Chinese react with their own military coercion,” Sun said. But in the current situation, “they have to consider the consequences of overreaction,” she added.\n\nHouse Speaker Kevin McCarthy talks to reporters at the Capitol in Washington on March 24, 2023. J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nRising pressure\n\nThe expected meeting, which McCarthy’s office announced earlier this week would take place on Wednesday, also comes at a precarious moment in US-China relations.\n\nWashington and Beijing are struggling to stabilize their communication amid flaring tensions over issues from a downed suspected Chinese surveillance balloon to semiconductor supply chains – raising the stakes of potential damage to that relationship if Beijing lashes out as it did when Tsai met Pelosi.\n\nTaiwan is still feeling the fallout of that response last August, with Chinese military forces now regularly making incursions over what had previously been an informal but largely respected border of control between Beijing and Taipei in the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan’s official Central News Agency also reported Monday that Tsai would meet with McCarthy, citing Tsai’s presidential office.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback See image of a Chinese balloon hovering over Taiwan 03:05 • Source: CNN See image of a Chinese balloon hovering over Taiwan 03:05\n\nBut a meeting between Tsai and the leader of the Republican majority in the US House of Representatives, who ranks second in line to the Presidency, would mark another symbolic moment for Taiwan and the US, which only maintain unofficial ties.\n\nFor Tsai, who is entering the final year of her two-term presidency, “it’s clearly a capstone event,” according to Wen-Ti Sung, a political scientist at the Australian National University’s Taiwan Studies Program. “She has this image as the Taiwanese president who has taken US-Taiwan relations to new heights, and who … has been able to give Taiwan almost unprecedented international visibility,” he said.\n\nThat increased visibility – and enhanced cooperation with the US – has followed China’s mounting pressure on the island, which sits fewer than 110 miles (177 kilometers) from the mainland coast.\n\nChina’s Communist Party claims the self-governing island democracy as its own despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to take the island, by force if necessary.\n\nThe party has undertaken a sweeping expansion of its military capabilities over the past decade under leader Xi Jinping – and ramped up its pervasive economic, diplomatic and military pressure on Taiwan.\n\nThat’s driven concerns, among some in Washington, that Beijing is preparing for an invasion, though China’s official language still suggests that scenario is not its preferred option for achieving the claimed goal of “reunification.”\n\nIt is those pressures – and how to support Taiwan against unilateral actions by Beijing – that are likely to be on the table when Tsai, McCarthy and a bipartisan group of US lawmakers sit down on Wednesday.\n\nCongress has been a pillar of increasing American support for Taiwan in recent years. Lawmakers regularly visit the island and drive bipartisan legislation enhancing support and cooperation.\n\nWhile the US switched its diplomatic relations to Beijing decades ago, it maintains unofficial ties with Taiwan and is bound by law to provide the democratic island with the means to defend itself.\n\nUnder Washington’s longstanding “One China” policy, the US acknowledges China’s position that Taiwan is part of China, but has never officially recognized Beijing’s claim to the island of 23 million.\n\nThough McCarthy does not have Pelosi’s decades-long record of advocacy regarding China, the California Republican is now a leading voice pushing for closer scrutiny of Beijing, and meeting Tsai could help him to burnish that image.\n\nLast month, McCarthy told reporters that meeting Tsai in the US would not impact whether he travels to Taiwan in the future – something he had earlier said he wanted to do.\n\nFighter jets of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Eastern Theater Command conduct joint combat training exercises around Taiwan on August 7, 2022 in this photo released by Xinhua News Agency. Gong Yulong/Xinhua/AP\n\nBeijing watching\n\nA meeting in California, on US soil, is widely seen as less likely to provoke Beijing than a McCarthy visit to Taiwan.\n\nPelosi’s trip – the first from a lawmaker of that rank to the island in 25 years – generated a fever pitch of nationalist and anti-US rhetoric in mainland China.\n\nThis time, so far, domestic conversation in China’s heavily controlled media sphere has been significantly muted.\n\nBut the stakes remain high – including for Beijing itself – over how it responds, analysts say.\n\nAs Taiwan prepares for a presidential election in January, a fierce response could push voters away from Taiwan’s main opposition party Kuomintang (KMT), widely seen as more friendly toward Beijing.\n\nIt could also jar with another high profile trip happening now: a tour of mainland China from former Taiwan president and senior KMT member Ma Ying-jeou, the first visit from a current or former Taiwan leader since the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949.\n\nMa’s tour is a “once in a half a century opportunity to send a conciliatory message between the two sides, Beijing shouldn’t want to tank that,” said Sung, the political scientist.\n\nChina is also acutely aware that its actions toward Taiwan are under a significantly brighter global spotlight following the invasion of Ukraine by Russian President Vladimir Putin, a close diplomatic partner of Xi. Putin’s rhetoric over Ukraine has echoes of how Xi speaks of Taiwan.\n\nBeijing has recently sought to position itself as an agent of peace in that conflict – especially as it aims to repair frayed ties with Europe.\n\nThis week, as Tsai is expected to meet with McCarthy, French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will head to China – an important opportunity that Xi may not want to overshadow with military posturing.\n\nAn aggressive response also risks stoking confrontation with the US, not yet six months after Xi and US President Joe Biden called to enhance communication during a face-to-face meeting in Bali.\n\n“(A less overtly aggressive response) would imply that Beijing does not wish to escalate tension with the US to a level that can risk getting out of hand,” said Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London.\n\n“A reset in US-China ties is not on the agenda, but an easing of tension is not beyond the realm of possibility.”",

    "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nAstronauts who will helm the first crewed moon mission in five decades were revealed on Monday, queuing up the quartet to begin training for the historic Artemis II lunar flyby that is set to take off in November 2024.\n\nThe astronauts are NASA’s Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover and Christina Koch, and Jeremy Hansen of the Canadian Space Agency.\n\nWiseman is a 47-year-old decorated naval aviator and test pilot who was first selected to be a NASA astronaut in 2009. A native of Baltimore, Maryland, he’s completed one prior spaceflight, a 165-day trip to the International Space Station that had launched aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket in 2014. Most recently, Wiseman served as chief of the astronaut office before stepping down in November 2022, making him eligible for a flight assignment.\n\nWiseman will serve as commander of the Artemis II mission.\n\nHansen, 47, is a fighter pilot who was selected by the Canadian Space Agency for astronaut training in 2009. From London, Ontario, Hansen is one of only four active Canadian astronauts, and he recently became the first Canadian to be put in charge of training for a new class of NASA astronauts.\n\nHe will be the first Canadian ever to travel to deep space.\n\nGlover is a 46-year-old naval aviator who returned to Earth from his first spaceflight in 2021 after piloting the second crewed flight of SpaceX’s Crew Dragon spacecraft and spending nearly six months aboard the International Space Station.\n\n“It’s so much more than the four names that have been announced,” Glover said during the Monday announcement at NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston. “We need to celebrate this moment in human history. … It is the next step in the journey that will get humanity to Mars.”\n\nGlover, born in Pomona, California, served in several military squadrons in the United States and Japan in the 2000s, and he completed test pilot training with the US Air Force. When he was selected for the NASA astronaut corps in 2013, he was working in the US Senate as a legislative fellow. All told, Glover logged 3,000 flight hours in more than 40 aircraft, over 400 carrier arrested landings and 24 combat missions.\n\nGlover’s first mission to space was as part of the SpaceX Crew-1 team, which launched to the International Space Station in November 2020 for a six-month stay on the orbiting laboratory.\n\nKoch, 44, is a veteran of six spacewalks — including the first all-female spacewalk in 2019. She holds the record for the longest single spaceflight by a woman, with a total of 328 days in space. Koch is also an an electrical engineer who helped develop scientific instruments for multiple NASA mission. Koch, a native of Grand Rapids, Michigan, also spent a year at the South Pole, an arduous stay that could well prepare her for the intensity of a moon mission.\n\nAbout this mission\n\nThe Artemis II mission will build on Artemis I, an uncrewed test mission that sent NASA’s Orion capsule on a 1.4 million-mile voyage to lap the moon that concluded in December. The space agency deemed that mission a success and is still working to review all the data collected.\n\nThe Artemis II lunar flyby mission crew members include (from left): NASA astronauts Christina Koch, Victor Glover, Reid Wiseman (foreground) and Canadian Space Agency astronaut Jeremy Hansen. Josh Valcarcel/NASA\n\nIf all goes to plan, Artemis II will take off around November 2024. The crew members, strapped inside the Orion spacecraft, will launch atop a NASA-developed Space Launch System rocket from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\n\nThe journey is expected to last about 10 days and will send the crew out beyond the moon, potentially further than any human has traveled in history, though the exact distance is yet to be determined.\n\nThe “exact distance beyond the Moon will depend on the day of liftoff and the relative distance of the Moon from the Earth at the time of the mission,” NASA spokesperson Kathryn Hambleton said via email.\n\nAfter circling the moon, the spacecraft will return to Earth for a splashdown landing in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nArtemis II is expected to pave the way for the Artemis III mission later this decade, which NASA has vowed will put the first woman and person of color on the lunar surface. It will also mark the first time humans have touched down on the moon since the Apollo program ended in 1972.\n\nThe Artemis III mission is expected to take off later this decade. But much of the technology the mission will require, including spacesuits for walking on the moon and a lunar lander to ferry the astronauts to the moon’s surface, is still in development.\n\nNASA is targeting a 2025 launch date for Artemis III, though the space agency’s inspector general has already said delays will likely push the mission to 2026 or later.\n\nThe space agency has been seeking to return people to the moon for more than a decade. The Artemis program was designed to pave the way to establishing a permanent lunar outpost, allowing astronauts to live and work deeper into space long term as NASA and its partners map a path to sending the first humans to Mars.\n\nPicking the astronauts\n\nVanessa Wyche, the director of NASA’s Johnson Space Center, declined to provide details to CNN about the selection process. But she emphasized the diversity of the Artemis II crew, which includes men and women rather than only a staff of White male test pilots as has been the case for historic missions of the past.\n\n“I can tell you, they still all have the right stuff,” Wyche said. “We have requirements different than we did (when we) just had test pilots” on inaugural missions.\n\nKoch said in an interview with CNN’s Ed Lavandera that the group found out they were selected a few weeks ago.\n\n“We were all sent to a meeting that was on our calendars under a different pretext that didn’t sound as lofty as the one it was going to be,” Koch said. “And accidentally two of us were very late to that meeting.”\n\nShe said the offer rendered her “speechless.”\n\n“It truly is an honor,” she added. “It’s an honor — not to get myself in the space — but because it’s amazing to be a part of this team that’s going back to the moon and on to Mars.”\n\nAn interview with the four astronauts will air on “CNN This Morning” on Tuesday, which starts at 6 am ET.",

    "text": "CNN —\n\nFrench government minister Marlene Schiappa has come under fire from members of her own party after appearing on the front cover of Playboy magazine.\n\nSchiappa, who has been a government minister since 2017, appeared on the cover of the magazine to accompany a 12-page interview she did on women’s and LGBT rights. Schiappa, who is the current Minister for the Social Economy and French Associations, was photographed for the cover wearing a white dress.\n\nSchiappa has been a long-time advocate for women’s rights and was appointed as the country’s first ever Gender Equality Minister in 2017. In this role, she successfully spearheaded a new sexual harassment law which allows for on the spot fines to be issued to men who catcall, harass or follow women on the street.\n\nHer appearance has drawn criticism from political colleagues including French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne.\n\nBorne pulled up Schiappa over the cover, telling her it “wasn’t appropriate, especially during this period,” CNN affiliate BFMTV reported Saturday, citing a source close to the prime minister.\n\nFrance is currently in the throes of a political and social crisis triggered by French President Emmanuel Macron’s move to push ahead with controversial pension reforms despite widespread public opposition.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Trash is piling up on the streets of Paris. Here's why 01:48 • Source: CNN Trash is piling up on the streets of Paris. Here's why 01:48\n\n“We are in the middle of a social crisis, there is the issue of policing, there are people between life and death, and I have the impression of being behind a smoke screen,” Sandrine Rousseau, Green Party politician and fellow women’s rights activist, told BFMTV Friday.\n\nFrench politician, Jean Luc Mélenchon who came third in the 2022 presidential elections criticized both Schiappa’s appearance and the decision by French President Emmanuel Macron to give an interview to children’s magazine, Pif Gadget, this week.\n\n“In a country where the President expresses himself in Pif and his minister in Playboy, the problem would be the opposition. France is going off the rails,” Mélenchon tweeted Saturday.\n\nSchiappa responded to her critics in a tweet on Saturday, saying: “Defending the right of women to have control of their bodies, that’s everywhere and all the time. In France, women are free. With all due respect to the detractors and hypocrites.”\n\nFrench Interior Minister, Gérald Darmanin came to Schiappa’s defense during an interview with French news channel CNews on Sunday calling her a “woman of character.”\n\n“I wanted to say that Marlene Schiappa is a courageous female politician who has her character and who has her style which is not mine, but I respect,” he remarked.",

    "text": "London CNN —\n\nThe British pound crashed to a record low last fall as investors rebelled against budget plans by former Prime Minister Liz Truss. Now, it’s enjoying a comeback.\n\nSterling hit its highest level against the US dollar in 10 months on Tuesday, topping $1.25 for the first time since June 2022. The pound, which has advanced about 3.3% versus the greenback since the start of 2023, is the best-performing currency among developed economies this year.\n\nThe UK currency has been boosted by indications the country’s economy is holding up better than expected. Activity is now thought to have expanded 0.1% in the final three months of last year, up from a previous estimate of no growth at all. Gross domestic product growth in January has been estimated at 0.3% after dropping 0.5% in December.\n\nThis resilience is bolstering expectations the Bank of England will maintain aggressive interest rate hikes despite concerns about the health of the global banking sector. Rising rates can boost the domestic currency because they help attract foreign investors searching for higher returns.\n\nInflation in the United Kingdom also jumped to an annual rate of 10.4% in February, underscoring the need for the Bank of England to maintain its tough approach.\n\nThe pound turnaround\n\nThe pound plunged close to $1.03 in September 2022 after the Truss government unveiled plans to boost borrowing while slashing taxes, unleashing panic in financial markets that fueled fears of a recession in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund predicted in January that the UK economy would contract by 0.6% this year, while all other advanced economies would grow, if only slightly.\n\n“There was a lot of pessimism being priced into the pound,” said Francesco Pesole, a currency strategist at ING.\n\nBut the sharp pullback in energy prices and China’s reopening have provided some relief about the economic outlook since the start of the year.\n\n“There was a big re-rating of growth expectations around Europe, and that impacted the UK,” Pesole said.\n\nThe euro has also been lifted by these dynamics, rising 2.3% against the US dollar in 2023. The pound’s rally has been sharper in large part because its 2022 declines were more severe, according to Pesole.\n\nBoth currencies have been aided by the greenback’s sharp drop from highs reached last September as recession fears have percolated in the United States.\n\nA lack of clarity around the Federal Reserve’s next steps has also restrained the dollar in recent weeks. Investor speculation has increased that the Fed could pause or stop rate hikes due to concerns about the economy following the failure of Silicon Valley Bank last month.\n\nJordan Rochester, a currency strategist at Nomura, said he thinks the pound could rise to $1.30 this year and “potentially higher.” But he still sees risks given the uncertainty surrounding the Bank of England’s plans and how rate rises will feed back through the country’s economy. And Pesole cautioned that currency fluctuations are often overdone when markets are choppy, as they are now.\n\n“In a volatile market environment, moves are exacerbated,” he said.",

    "text": "CNN —\n\nFinland’s left-wing Prime Minister Sanna Marin conceded defeat on Sunday in the Nordic country’s parliamentary election as the opposition right-wing National Coalition Party (NCP) claimed victory in a tightly fought contest.\n\nThe pro-business NCP was expected to win 48 of the 200 seats in parliament, narrowly ahead of the nationalist Finns Party with 46 seats and Marin’s Social Democrats on 43 seats, justice ministry election data showed with all ballots counted.\n\n“We got the biggest mandate,” NCP leader Petteri Orpo said in a speech to followers, vowing to “fix Finland” and its economy.\n\nHe will get the first chance at forming a coalition to obtain majority in parliament as Marin’s era as prime minister was expected to end.\n\n“We have gained support, we have gained more seats (in parliament). That’s an excellent achievement, even if we did not finish first today,” the prime minister said in a speech to party members.\n\nMarin, 37, the world’s youngest prime minister when she took office in 2019, is considered by fans around the globe as a millennial role model for progressive new leaders, but at home she has faced criticism for her partying and her government’s public spending.\n\nWhile she remains very popular among many Finns, particularly young moderates, she antagonized some conservatives with lavish spending on pensions and education they see as not frugal enough.\n\nThe NCP has led in polls for almost two years although its lead had melted away in recent months. It has promised to curb spending and stop the rise of public debt, which has reached just over 70% of GDP since Marin took office in 2019.\n\nOrpo accused Marin of eroding Finland’s economic resilience at a time when Europe’s energy crisis, driven by Russia’s war in Ukraine, has hit the country hard and the cost of living has increased.\n\nOrpo has said he will negotiate with all groups to obtain a majority in parliament, while Marin has said her Social Democrats may govern with the NCP but will not go into government with the Finns Party.\n\nMarin called the Finns Party “openly racist” during a debate in January – an accusation the nationalist group rejected.\n\nThe National Coalition Chairman Petteri Orpo celebrates with supporters following the Finnish parliamentary elections, on April 2, 2023, in Helsinki. Alessandro Rampazzo/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe Finns Party’s main goal is to reduce what leader Riikka Purra has called “harmful” immigration from developing countries outside the European Union. It also calls for austerity policies to curb deficit spending, a stance it shares with the NCP.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Who is Sanna Marin? (2019) 02:10 • Source: CNN Who is Sanna Marin? (2019) 02:10\n\nMost notable of Marin’s foreign policy actions has been her push, along with President Sauli Niinisto, for the country to make a watershed policy U-turn by seeking NATO membership in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThat process is now almost complete, with Helsinki expected to join within days after all the Western defense alliance’s 30 members approved the accession.",

    "text": "CNN —\n\nIt is one of China’s most popular shopping apps, selling clothing, groceries and just about everything else under the sun to more than 750 million users a month.\n\nBut according to cybersecurity researchers, it can also bypass users’ cell phone security to monitor activities on other apps, check notifications, read private messages and change settings.\n\nAnd once installed, it’s tough to remove.\n\nWhile many apps collect vast troves of user data, sometimes without explicit consent, experts say e-commerce giant Pinduoduo has taken violations of privacy and data security to the next level.\n\nIn a detailed investigation, CNN spoke to half a dozen cybersecurity teams from Asia, Europe and the United States — as well as multiple former and current Pinduoduo employees — after receiving a tipoff.\n\nMultiple experts identified the presence of malware on the Pinduoduo app that exploited vulnerabilities in Android operating systems. Company insiders said the exploits were utilized to spy on users and competitors, allegedly to boost sales.\n\n“We haven’t seen a mainstream app like this trying to escalate their privileges to gain access to things that they’re not supposed to gain access to,” said Mikko Hyppönen, chief research officer at WithSecure, a Finnish cybersecurity firm.\n\n“This is highly unusual, and it is pretty damning for Pinduoduo.”\n\nThis is highly unusual, and it is pretty damning for Pinduoduo. Mikko Hyppönen, cybersecurity expert\n\nMalware, short for malicious software, refers to any software developed to steal data or interfere with computer systems and mobile devices.\n\nEvidence of sophisticated malware in the Pinduoduo app comes amid intense scrutiny of Chinese-developed apps like TikTok over concerns about data security.\n\nSome American lawmakers are pushing for a national ban on the popular short-video app, whose CEO Shou Chew was grilled by Congress for five hours last week about its relations with the Chinese government.\n\nThe revelations are also likely to draw more attention to Pinduoduo’s international sister app, Temu, which is topping US download charts and fast expanding in other Western markets. Both are owned by Nasdaq-listed PDD, a multinational company with roots in China.\n\nWhile Temu has not been implicated, Pinduoduo’s alleged actions risk casting a shadow over its sister app’s global expansion.\n\nThere is no evidence that Pinduoduo has handed data to the Chinese government. But as Beijing enjoys significant leverage over businesses under its jurisdiction, there are concerns from US lawmakers that any company operating in China could be forced to cooperate with a broad range of security activities.\n\nPinduoduo's parent company PDD is listed on the Nasdaq in New York. Mike Segar/Reuters/File\n\nThe findings follow Google’s suspension of Pinduoduo from its Play Store in March, citing malware identified in versions of the app.\n\nAn ensuing report from Bloomberg said a Russian cybersecurity firm had also identified potential malware in the app.\n\nPinduoduo has previously rejected “the speculation and accusation that Pinduoduo app is malicious.”\n\nCNN has contacted PDD multiple times over email and phone for comment, but has not received a response.\n\nRise to success\n\nPinduoduo, which boasts a user base that accounts for three quarters of China’s online population and a market value three times that of eBay (EBAY), wasn’t always an online shopping behemoth.\n\nFounded in 2015 in Shanghai by Colin Huang, a former Google employee, the startup was fighting to establish itself in a market long dominated by e-commerce stalwarts Alibaba (BABA) and JD.com (JD).\n\nIt succeeded by offering steep discounts on friends-and-family group buying orders and focusing on lower-income rural areas.\n\nPinduoduo posted triple digit growth in monthly users until the end of 2018, the year it listed in New York. By the middle of 2020, though, the increase in monthly users had slowed to around 50% and would continue to decline, according to its earnings reports.\n\nColin Huang, a former Google employee, founded Pinduoduo in 2015 in Shanghai. He stepped down as CEO in 2020 and resigned as chairman the following year. VCG/VCG/Getty Images/File\n\nIt was in 2020, according to a current Pinduoduo employee, that the company set up a team of about 100 engineers and product managers to dig for vulnerabilities in Android phones, develop ways to exploit them — and turn that into profit.\n\nAccording to the source, who requested anonymity for fear of reprisals, the company only targeted users in rural areas and smaller towns initially, while avoiding users in megacities such as Beijing and Shanghai.\n\n“The goal was to reduce the risk of being exposed,” they said.\n\nBy collecting expansive data on user activities, the company was able to create a comprehensive portrait of users’ habits, interests and preferences, according to the source.\n\nThis allowed it to improve its machine learning model to offer more personalized push notifications and ads, attracting users to open the app and place orders, they said.\n\nThe team was disbanded in early March, the source added, after questions about their activities came to light.\n\nPDD didn’t reply to CNN’s repeated requests for comment on the team.\n\nWhat experts found\n\nApproached by CNN, researchers from Tel Aviv-based cyber firm Check Point Research, Delaware-based app security startup Oversecured and Hyppönen’s WithSecure conducted independent analysis of the 6.49.0 version of the app, released on Chinese app stores in late February.\n\nGoogle Play is not available in China, and Android users in the country download their apps from local stores. In March, when Google suspended Pinduoduo, it said it had found malware in off-Play versions of the app.\n\nThe researchers found code designed to achieve “privilege escalation”: a type of cyberattack that exploits a vulnerable operating system to gain a higher level of access to data than it’s supposed to have, according to experts.\n\n“Our team has reverse engineered that code and we can confirm that it tries to escalate rights, tries to gain access to things normal apps wouldn’t be able to do on Android phones,” said Hyppönen.\n\nIn China, about three quarters of smartphone users are on the Android system. Luo Yunfei/China News Service/VCG/Getty Images\n\nThe app was able to continue running in the background and prevent itself from being uninstalled, which allowed it to boost its monthly active user rates, Hyppönen said. It also had the ability to spy on competitors by tracking activity on other shopping apps and getting information from them, he added.\n\nCheck Point Research additionally identified ways in which the app was able to evade scrutiny.\n\nThe app deployed a method that allowed it to push updates without an app store review process meant to detect malicious applications, the researchers said.\n\nThey also identified in some plug-ins the intent to obscure potentially malicious components by hiding them under legitimate file names, such as Google’s.\n\n“Such a technique is widely used by malware developers that inject malicious code into applications that have legitimate functionality,” they said.\n\nAndroid targeted\n\nIn China, about three quarters of smartphone users are on the Android system. Apple (AAPL)’s iPhone has 25% market share, according to Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities.\n\nSergey Toshin, the founder of Oversecured, said Pinduoduo’s malware specifically targeted different Android-based operating systems, including those used by Samsung, Huawei, Xiaomi and Oppo.\n\nCNN has reached out to these companies for comment.\n\nToshin described Pinduoduo as “the most dangerous malware” ever found among mainstream apps.\n\n“I’ve never seen anything like this before. It’s like, super expansive,” he said.\n\nMost phone manufacturers globally customize the core Android software, the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), to add unique features and applications to their own devices.\n\nToshin found Pinduoduo to have exploited about 50 Android system vulnerabilities. Most of the exploits were tailor made for customized parts known as the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) code, which tends to be audited less often than AOSP and is therefore more prone to vulnerabilities, he said.\n\nPinduoduo also exploited a number of AOSP vulnerabilities, including one which was flagged by Toshin to Google in February 2022. Google fixed the bug this March, he said.\n\nI’ve never seen anything like this before. It’s like, super expansive. Sergey Toshin, Android security expert\n\nAccording to Toshin, the exploits allowed Pinduoduo access to users’ locations, contacts, calendars, notifications and photo albums without their consent. They were also able to change system settings and access users’ social network accounts and chats, he said.\n\nOf the six teams CNN spoke to for this story, three did not conduct full examinations. But their primary reviews showed that Pinduoduo asked for a large number of permissions beyond the normal functions of a shopping app.\n\nThey included “potentially invasive permissions” such as “set wallpaper” and “download without notification,” said René Mayrhofer, head of the Institute of Networks and Security at the Johannes Kepler University Linz in Austria.\n\nPeople using their phones on the Beijing subway in July 2022. Sheldon Cooper/SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty Images\n\nDisbanding the team\n\nSuspicions about malware in Pinduoduo’s app were first raised in late February in a report by a Chinese cybersecurity firm called Dark Navy. Even though the analysis didn’t directly name the shopping giant, the report spread quickly among other researchers, who did name the company. Some of the analysts followed up with their own reports confirming the original findings.\n\nSoon after, on March 5, Pinduoduo issued a new update of its app, version 6.50.0, which removed the exploits, according to two experts who CNN spoke to.\n\nTwo days after the update, Pinduoduo disbanded the team of engineers and product managers who had developed the exploits, according to the Pinduoduo source.\n\nThe next day, team members found themselves locked out of Pinduoduo’s bespoke workplace communication app, Knock, and lost access to files on the company’s internal network. Engineers also found their access to big data, data sheets and the log system revoked, the source said.\n\nMost of the team were transferred to work at Temu. They were assigned to different departments at the subsidiary, with some working on marketing or developing push notifications, according to the source.\n\nA core group of about 20 cybersecurity engineers who specialize in finding and exploiting vulnerabilities remain at Pinduoduo, they said.\n\nToshin of Oversecured, who looked into the update, said although the exploits were removed, the underlying code was still there and could be reactivated to carry out attacks.\n\nOversight failure\n\nPinduoduo has been able to grow its user base against a backdrop of the Chinese government’s regulatory clampdown on Big Tech that began in late 2020.\n\nThat year, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology launched a sweeping crackdown on apps that illegally collect and use personal data.\n\nIn 2021, Beijing passed its first comprehensive data privacy legislation.\n\nThe Personal Information Protection Law stipulates that no party should illegally collect, process or transmit personal information. They’re also banned from exploiting internet-related security vulnerabilities or engaging in actions that endanger cybersecurity.\n\nPinduoduo’s apparent malware would be a violation of those laws, tech policy experts say, and should have been detected by the regulator.\n\n“This would be embarrassing for the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, because this is their job,” said Kendra Schaefer, a tech policy expert at Trivium China, a consultancy. “They’re supposed to check Pinduoduo, and the fact that they didn’t find (anything) is embarrassing for the regulator.”\n\nThe ministry has regularly published lists to name and shame apps found to have undermined user privacy or other rights. It also publishes a separate list of apps that are removed from app stores for failing to comply with regulations.\n\nPinduoduo did not appear on any of the lists.\n\nThey’re supposed to check Pinduoduo, and the fact that they didn’t find (anything) is embarrassing for the regulator. Kendra Schaefer, tech policy expert\n\nCNN has reached out to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and the Cyberspace Administration of China for comment.\n\nOn Chinese social media, some cybersecurity experts questioned why regulators haven’t taken any action.\n\n“Probably none of our regulators can understand coding and programming, nor do they understand technology. You can’t even understand the malicious code when it’s shoved right in front of your face,” a cybersecurity expert with 1.8 million followers wrote last week in a viral post on Weibo, a Twitter-like platform.\n\nThe post was censored the next day.",

    "text": "CNN —\n\nThe escalating climate crisis is shifting many people’s purchasing patterns and this extends to the $500 billion dollar global beauty industry which is grappling with a range of sustainability challenges across product manufacturing, packaging and disposal.\n\nStrategy and consulting firm Simon Kucher’s Global Sustainability Study 2021 found 60% of consumers around the world rated sustainability as an important purchase criterion, and 35% were willing to pay more for sustainable products or services.\n\nThis shift in consumer preferences has propelled many beauty brands to set environmental goals: to move away from single-use and virgin plastics, provide recyclable, reusable and refillable packaging and offer more transparency around products’ ingredients so customers can ascertain how “green” their purchase is.\n\nHowever, consumers still struggle to understand the sustainability credentials of many products, according to the British Beauty Council. This is because the industry’s clean-up efforts have been inconsistent, and fall short of making a recognizable impact in the absence of collective goal-setting, global strategy and standardized regulations.\n\nIngredient and branding transparency\n\nThere is no international standard for the beauty industry on how much product ingredient information to share with customers — or how to do so. Brands can set their own rules and goals, giving rise to confusion and “greenwashing,” where sustainability claims are often touted but not substantiated.\n\nCompanies often use marketing language like “clean beauty” to make it seem like their products are natural, for example, when they may not actually be organic, sustainable or ethically made.\n\n“The term ‘clean beauty’ has become quite dangerous. It’s used to sell more products,” according to British Beauty Council CEO Millie Kendall, who added that such buzzwords are losing traction in the UK as British customers wise up to their shortcomings. “Customers need better marketing information and certification information.”\n\nIn a 2021 report calling on the industry to have “the courage to change” their business practices, the British Beauty Council wrote that, all too often, even natural ingredients involved in manufacturing products give way to “over-consumption, non-regenerative farming practices, pollution, waste and neglect.”\n\n“The only way out of this is transparency,” Kendall told CNN.\n\nJen Lee, chief impact officer at US-based brand Beautycounter, said she continues to see confusion over ingredients among consumers. (In 2013, the company launched and published “The Never List,” which currently cites more than 2,800 chemicals — including heavy metals, parabens and formaldehyde — it claims to never use in its products.)\n\n“Natural vs. synthetic ingredients has been a conversation. People think natural is safer, but it’s not always the case,” Lee explained. “Natural ingredients formulated in the industry can have toxic load. Heavy metals can occur in natural components of the earth.”\n\n“We used to be more natural and organic,” added Sasha Plavsic, founder of makeup brand ILIA Beauty. “What was challenging is (that) raw materials were difficult to source or would come in inconsistently or products wouldn’t perform.”\n\nMost makeup is created and molded at high temperatures, Plavsic explained. Purely organic materials often fall apart in this heat, leading to inconsistent results and subpar product performance. “Not every synthetic is bad,” Plavsic said. “Sometimes, it helps create the best in class formula.”\n\nUnpacking plastics\n\nThe industry’s plastic packaging is a particular sustainability challenge — 95% is thrown away and the vast majority is not recycled, according to the British Beauty Council.\n\nThe cosmetics business is the fourth biggest plastic packaging user globally — after food and beverage, industrial packaging and pharmaceuticals — and plastic is about 67% of the industry’s packaging volume, according to Vantage Market Research. Beauty giant L’Oreal used 144,430 metric tons of plastic in its packaging material in 2021, for example, according to the Ellen Macarthur Foundation (EMF). Estee Lauder Companies reported its brands produced 71,600 metric tons of plastic in product packaging that same year.\n\nAnd only 9% of the global plastic waste is recycled, according to a report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The United States only recycles 4% of its plastic waste.\n\nMany brands are trying to phase out harmful plastics from their operations and adopt post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastic. (L’Oreal has set a target of 50% PCR plastic usage by 2025, while Estee Lauder is targeting 25% “or more” PCR plastic — but both are far from achieving their targets.)\n\n“Between 60-70 major global brands have made unprecedented progress” in PCR plastic usage across industries, EMF’s Plastic Initiative Lead Sander DeFruyt told CNN. But DeFruyt stressed that PCR plastic must be adopted in conjunction with brands removing single and virgin plastics from their usage cycles to truly make a difference.\n\nHowever, PCR plastic is not easy to find — low recycling rates around the world mean there is limited supply. Meanwhile, demand for it is growing demand across industries, DeFruyt said. This competition hikes up its price, which is already higher than virgin plastic.\n\nHair care brand FEKKAI claims that it used up to 95% PCR content in its packaging, but pricing and supply issues posed a challenge, forcing it to currently aim for containers and packaging that feature at least 50% PCR in its packaging.\n\n“PCR plastic is more expensive than stock plastic. The cost is hard and then sourcing it is too,” founder Frédéric Fekkai told CNN. “PCR is close to our heart, but there is a massive demand, so finding recycled plastic is difficult.”\n\nThe weight of retail\n\nBeauty retailers plays a pivotal — and under-utilized — role, with control over stocking decisions and supply chains. But many vary when it comes to the standards they set for brands they sell.\n\n“Smaller businesses do more, full stop,” said Jessi Baker, founder of the technology platform Provenance, which helps brands display their sustainability credentials for customers. “They move more nimbly. Some of them are born-good brands — climate friendliness was part of their setup. They don’t need to restructure their entire supply chain. Their culture already has it compared to the larger brands who need to work hard to change.”\n\nSephora launched its “Clean + Planet Positive” initiative in 2021, which labeled products that met its set criteria. (This is separate from the French retailer’s “Clean at Sephora” program, which is currently facing a consumer lawsuit alleging it carries a significant percentage of products understood by customers to be harmful.) Target launched a similar program in 2022, featuring a “Target Zero” icon for both online and in-store offerings that either have reusable, recyclable, compostable or reduced plastic packaging, or feature waterless or concentrated products.\n\nStill, many steps taken by brands and retailers do not even begin to touch on the waste and pollution generated throughout supply chains, manufacturing and shipping, all huge problems for the industry to grapple with.\n\nThe missing player\n\nThe gaps in standardization in the beauty ecosystem can, to some extent, be filled by certifications such as the US-born B Corporation, or B Corp. This accreditation, one of the most well-known in the beauty space, is issued by the non-profit B Lab, which scores a company on a variety of criteria around ethics and sustainability. However beneficial it may be among eco-conscious consumers, though, it is currently completely voluntary for brands to apply for.\n\nGovernments and multinationals enforcing regulations and setting a base line for brands to operate from when making sustainability claims would go a long way to making change, many experts and business leaders believe.\n\nSusanne Kaufmann, founder of her namesake beauty brand, says her efforts in Austria would reap better results if more countries around the world had stricter, more uniform garbage disposal laws.\n\n“I package our product in a recyclable material,” Kaufmann said. (Her products’ packaging, which is refillable and reusable, is made from 75% recycled plastic — and is 100% recyclable.) If I send this to the US, the garbage is not separated… and it’s not recyclable,” she explained, referring to inconsistencies in recycling laws across the United States.\n\nAnd when it comes to ingredients, the European Chemicals Agency lists 2,495 substances banned from use in cosmetic products marketed for sale or use in the bloc. But the US Food and Drug administration only lists 11, making it more challenging for American consumers to find safer, greener options. The Environmental Working Group, a non-profit watchdog, studied lab tests of 51 sunscreen products in 2021 and found that only 35% of products met the EU standard, compared with 94% that passed the US standard.\n\nHowever, while government can set minimum requirements, Mia Davis, vice president of sustainability and impact at beauty retailer Credo Beauty, says the needle will move in the private sector.\n\n“Regulation can raise the floor a bit. A person who doesn’t know about any (sustainability issues) should still be able to walk into a bodega and get clean products… But that’s never going to be what the market can do,” she said. “Market leadership is key.”\n\nIn the absence of bold regulations or global standards on sustainability practices, this “leadership” — undertaken both by brands and customers in the beauty marketplace — is likely to be the most immediately impactful vector for addressing the industry’s climate shortcomings. It will take continued collective advocacy and initiative to see meaningful climate-conscious change.",

    "text": "CNN —\n\nScientists in Germany say they’ve been able to make a nasal vaccine that can shut down a Covid-19 infection in the nose and throat, where the virus gets its first foothold in the body.\n\nIn experiments in hamsters, two doses of the vaccine – which is made with a live but weakened form of the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 – blocked the virus from copying itself in the animals’ upper airways, achieving “sterilizing immunity” and preventing illness, a long-sought goal of the pandemic.\n\nAlthough this vaccine has several more hurdles to clear before it gets to a doctor’s office or drug store, other nasal vaccines are in use or are nearing the finish line in clinical trials.\n\nChina and India both rolled out vaccines given through the nasal tissues last fall, though it’s not clear how well they may be working. Studies on the effectiveness of these vaccines have yet to be published, leaving much of the world to wonder whether this approach to protection really works in people.\n\nHalting progress on next-generation Covid-19 vaccines\n\nThe US has reached something of a stalemate with Covid-19. Even with the darkest days of the pandemic behind us, hundreds of Americans are still dying daily as the infection continues to simmer in the background of our return to normal life.\n\nAs long as the virus continues to spread among people and animals, there’s always the potential for it mutate into a more contagious or more damaging version of itself. And while Covid infections have become manageable for most healthy people, they may still pose a danger to vulnerable groups such as the elderly and immunocompromised.\n\nResearchers hope next-generation Covid-19 vaccines, which aim to shut down the virus before it ever gets a chance to make us sick and ultimately prevent the spread of infection, could make our newest resident respiratory infection less of a threat.\n\nOne way scientists are trying to do that is by boosting mucosal immunity, beefing up immune defenses in the tissues that line the upper airways, right where the virus would land and begin to infect our cells.\n\nIt’s a bit like stationing firefighters underneath the smoke alarm in your house, says study author Emanuel Wyler, a scientist at the Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association in Berlin.\n\nThe immunity that’s created by shots works throughout the body, but it resides primarily in the blood. That means it may take longer to mount a response.\n\n“If they are already on site, they can immediately eliminate the fire, but if they’re like 2 miles away, they first need to drive there, and by that time, one-third of the house is already in full flames,” Wyler said.\n\nMucosal vaccines are also better at priming a different kind of first responder than injections do. They do a better job of summoning IgA antibodies, which have four arms to grab onto invaders instead of the two arms that the y-shaped IgG antibodies have. Some scientists think IgA antibodies may be less picky about their targets than IgG antibodies, which makes them better equipped to deal with new variants.\n\nThe new nasal vaccine takes a new approach to a very old idea: weakening a virus so it’s no longer a threat and then giving it to people so their immune systems can learn to recognize and fight it off. The first vaccines using this approach date to the 1870s, against anthrax and rabies. Back then, scientists weakened the agents they were using with heat and chemicals.\n\nThe researchers manipulated the genetic material in the virus to make it harder for cells to translate. This technique, called codon pair deoptimization, hobbles the virus so it can be shown to the immune system without making the body sick.\n\n“You could imagine reading a text … and every letter is a different font, or every letter is a different size, then the text is much harder to read. And this is basically what we do in codon pair deoptimization,” Wyler said.\n\nPromising results in animal studies\n\nIn the hamster studies, which were published Monday in the journal Nature Microbiology, two doses of the live but weakened nasal vaccine created a much stronger immune response than either two doses of an mRNA-based vaccine or one that uses an adenovirus to ferry the vaccine instructions into cells.\n\nThe researchers think the live weakened vaccine probably worked better because it closely mimics the process of a natural infection.\n\nThe nasal vaccine also previews the entire coronavirus for the body, not just its spike proteins like current Covid-19 vaccines do, so the hamsters were able to make immune weapons against a wider range of targets.\n\nAs promising as all this sounds, vaccine experts say caution is warranted. This vaccine still has to pass more tests before it’s ready for use, but they say the results look encouraging.\n\n“They did a very nice job. This is obviously a competent and thoughtful team that did this work, and impressive in the scope of what they did. Now it just needs to be repeated,” perhaps in primates and certainly in humans before it can be widely used, said Dr. Greg Poland, who designs vaccines at the Mayo Clinic. He was not involved in the new research.\n\nThe study began in 2021, before the Omicron variant was around, so the vaccine tested in these experiments was made with the original strain of the coronavirus. In the experiments, when they infected animals with Omicron, the live but weakened nasal vaccine still performed better than the others, but its ability to neutralize the virus was diminished. Researchers think it will need an update.\n\nIt also needs to be tested in humans, and Wyler says they’re working on that. The scientists have partnered with a Swiss company called RocketVax to start phase I clinical trials.\n\nOther vaccines are further along, but the progress has been “slow and halting,” Poland said. Groups working on these vaccines are struggling to raise the steep costs of getting a new vaccine to market, and they’re doing it in a setting where people tend to think the vaccine race has been won and done.\n\nIn reality, Poland said, we’re far from that. All it would take is another Omicron-level shift in the evolution of the virus, and we could be back at square one, with no effective tools against the coronavirus.\n\n“That’s foolish. We should be developing a pan-coronavirus vaccine that does induce mucosal immunity and that is long-lived,” he said.\n\nMore on the way\n\nAt least four nasal vaccines for Covid-19 have reached late-stage testing in people, according to the World Health Organization’s vaccine tracker.\n\nThe nasal vaccines in use in China and India rely on harmless adenoviruses to ferry their instructions into cells, although effectiveness data for these has not been published.\n\nTwo other nasal vaccines are finishing human studies.\n\nOne, a recombinant vaccine that can be produced cheaply in chicken eggs, the same way many flu vaccines are, is being put through its paces by researchers at Mount Sinai in New York City.\n\nAnother, like the German vaccine, uses a live but weakened version of the virus. It’s being developed by a company called Codagenix. Results of those studies, which were carried out in South America and Africa, may come later this year.\n\nThe German team says it’s eagerly watching for the Codagenix data.\n\n“They will be very important in order to know where whether this kind of attempt is basically promising or not,” Wyler said.\n\nThey have reason to worry. Respiratory infections have proved to be tough targets for inhaled vaccines.\n\nFluMist, a live but weakened form of the flu virus, works reasonably well in children but doesn’t help adults as much. The reason is thought to be that adults already have immune memory for the flu, and when the virus is injected into the nose, the vaccine mostly boosts what’s already there.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nStill, some of the most potent vaccines such as the vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella use live attenuated viruses, so it’s a promising approach.\n\nAnother consideration is that live vaccines can’t be taken by everyone. People with very compromised immunity are often cautioned against using live vaccines because even these very weakened viruses may be risky for them.\n\n“Although it’s strongly attenuated, it’s still a real virus,” Wyler said, so it would have to be used carefully.",

    "text": "Tel Aviv CNN —\n\nIn a sea of Israeli flags, Yiftach Golov holds one that looks a little different.\n\nAmong the hundreds of thousands of protesters who took to the streets for the 13th week in a row on Saturday, Golov hoists a brown flag that represents a group called “Brother and Sisters in Arms.”\n\nThey are veterans – many, like Golov, from elite forces – who now feel they are fighting on a new battlefield: To save Israeli democracy.\n\n“We believe this is our responsibility to go once again called to the flag of the nation to stop this madness to defend Israel,” Golov said, as he weaved his way through the protesters on Tel Aviv’s Kaplan street, between the high-rises that house many of Israel’s high tech companies.\n\nDuring the second intifada, in the early 2000s, Golov served in a special forces reconnaissance unit. He was never before particularly political, focusing more on getting his PhD in biophysics from Tel Aviv University.\n\nBut when the protest movement against the Israeli government’s judicial overhaul plan began in January, Golov attended one a demonstration and soon became one of thousands of veterans, and now military reservists, who have taken up the cause as their new mission.\n\nSome, including elite Air Force reservists, have taken it a step further, threatening not to heed the call to train or even serve in protest of the government’s plans planned judicial changes, which would give the governing parties more control over Israel’s judiciary.\n\nA group from Brothers and Sisters in Arms protests by carrying a figure wrapped in the Israeli flag on a stretcher, the way they would carry a wounded comrade off the field. CNN\n\nOthers have taken to becoming some of the most active organizers and demonstrators. Last week, a group from Brothers and Sisters in Arms protested by carrying a figure wrapped in the Israeli flag on a stretcher, the way they would carry a wounded comrade off the field.\n\nWhile Golov says he has not taken the drastic step to refuse service, he understands the motivation.\n\n“We’re fighting for justice and liberty, just like the American story, that’s the values that that are being represented symbolized back when we look at our flag, that’s something that was lacking lacking for the last few decades. So basically, we reclaim the flag,” he said.\n\nFellow members of the group, all wearing brown shirts with the organization’s logo, come up and say hello. They’re sprinkled all throughout the protests. One is even leading the “Pink Front,” a group of coordinated drummers who look like they are dressed for a rave, and often lead the chants at the protests.\n\nThey’re using skills they learned in the military – how to organize, how to mobilize – now for the protests. But more importantly, they say they have the same type of motivation.\n\n“The very deep feeling that you are part of something bigger than yourself, that (you’re) allowed to sacrifice anything that is needed, whether it’s your career, health, seriously mental health,” Golov said. “We all have a mission, you’re willing to do it at any cost. You’re very determined, you know that you are on the right side, you’re carrying the torch of light. That keeps us being highly motivated despite the fact that we’re not sleeping for days.”\n\nIsrael’s protest movement is made up of many disparate groups, but the pressure from Israel’s much vaunted veterans has been seen as a key to moving the needle.\n\nLast Monday, after weeks of sustained protests and the largest general strike in Israeli history, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced a pause to the legislation, to allow time for negotiations with the opposition.\n\nBut despite the announcements, protesters are still out in the streets in large numbers. CNN affiliate Channel 12 in Israel estimated the size of Saturday’s demonstration in Tel Aviv at about 150,000 people. Organizers claimed it was 230,000.\n\nIsraelis protest during a demonstration after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed the Defense Minister Yoav Gallant in Jerusalem, on March 27, 2023. Ilan Rosenberg/Reuters\n\nLast week’s mass protests and widespread strike action came after Netanyahu said he had decided to fire Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for advocating a delay in passing the legislation – a move that Netanyahu has since delayed, sources told CNN, due to “the present security situation.”\n\nIn his televised speech calling for a delay, Gallant had said the pause in the legislation was needed “for the security of Israel,” citing the refusal of some Israel Defense Forces reservists to train in protest of the government plans. He said pressing ahead with the proposals could threaten Israel’s security.\n\nUnder pressure at home and from allies abroad, Netanyahu said he would delay votes on the remaining legislation until after the Knesset’s Passover recess in April “to give time for a real chance for a real debate.”\n\n“Out of the responsibility to the nation, I decided to delay … the vote, in order to give time for discussion,” he added.\n\nBut Netanyahu indicated that the delay was only temporary. He insisted that the overhaul was necessary, and reiterated criticism of refusal to train or serve in the military in protest at the planned changes. “Refusing is the end of our country,” he said.\n\nMany protesters don’t believe that the pause is real, or say it’s simply a stalling tactic to give Netanyahu some breathing room and get the protesters to go home before he plows on with the reforms.\n\n“We will start doing deactivation only when we will know 100% that Israel state will stay a functional democratic country. Whatever needs to be done for that,” Golov said.",

    "text": "JPMorgan Chase on Friday reported first-quarter profit and revenue that roundly beat expectations, boosted by a year of rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe New York-based bank posted a profit of $12.6 billion or $4.10 per share. That’s up from $8.3 billion, or $2.63 per share from the same period a year before. Analysts expected earnings of $3.41 per share, according to Refinitiv.\n\nWith $3.67 trillion in assets, JPMorgan Chase is the largest bank in the United States and a bellwether for the US economy.\n\n“The US economy continues to be on generally healthy footings — consumers are still spending and have strong balance sheets, and businesses are in good shape. However, the storm clouds that we have been monitoring for the past year remain on the horizon,” CEO Jamie Dimon said in a press release.\n\nNet interest income rose to $20.8 billion, up 49% from the prior year, driven by the aggressive interest rate campaign the Fed kicked off last year to stabilize prices.\n\nDeposits rose to $2.38 trillion during the first quarter from $2.34 trillion in the quarter ended in December. That comes after the banking tumult last month triggered a rush into big banks from nervous customers. Investors also looked to money market funds as a haven.\n\nA key point of conversation after last month’s turmoil in the banking sector has been whether banks could tighten lending standards, leading customers to spend less as it becomes more difficult to borrow money for large purchases like homes and cars.\n\n“Financial conditions will likely tighten as lenders become more conservative, and we do not know if this will slow consumer spending,” Dimon said, adding that JPMorgan Chase is “confident that we can serve the needs of our customers and clients in all environments.”\n\nShares of JPMorgan Chase climbed 6.1% in pre-market trading. The company’s post-earnings conference call is slated for 8:30 a.m. ET.",

    "text": "New York CNN —\n\nSo far this tax season, the IRS has received more than 100 million income tax returns for 2022.\n\nThat means tens of millions of households have yet to file their returns. If yours is among them, here are some last-minute tax-filing tips to keep in mind as the Tuesday, April 18 deadline approaches.\n\nNot everyone has to file on April 18: If you live in a federally declared disaster area, have a business there — or have relevant tax documents stored by businesses in that area — it’s likely the IRS has already extended the filing and payment deadlines for you. Here is where you can find the specific extension dates for each disaster area.\n\nThanks to many rounds of extreme weather in recent months, for instance, tax filers in most of California — which accounts for 10% to 15% of all federal filers — have already been granted an extension until Oct. 16 to file and to pay, according to an IRS spokesperson.\n\nIf you’re in the armed forces and are currently or were recently stationed in a combat zone, the filing and payment deadlines for your 2022 taxes are most likely extended by 180 days. But your specific extended filing and payment deadlines will depend on the day you leave (or left) the combat zone. This IRS publication offers more detail.\n\nLastly, if you made little to no money last year (typically less than $12,950 for single filers and $25,900 for married couples), you may not be required to file a return. But you may want to anyway if you think you are eligible for a refund thanks to, for instance, refundable tax credits such as the Earned Income Tax Credit. (Use this IRS tool to gauge whether you are required to file this year.) You also are likely eligible to use IRS Free File (intended for those with adjusted gross income of $73,000 or less) so it won’t cost you to submit a return.\n\nYour paycheck may not be your only source of income: If you had one full-time job you may think that is the only income you made and have to report. But that’s not necessarily so.\n\nOther potentially taxable and reportable income sources include:\n\nInterest on your savings\n\nInvestment income (e.g., dividends and capital gains)\n\nPay for part-time or seasonal work, or a side hustle\n\nUnemployment income\n\nSocial Security benefits or distribution from a retirement account\n\nTips\n\nGambling winnings\n\nIncome from a rental property you own\n\nOrganize your tax documents: By now you should have received every tax document that third parties are required to send you (your employer, bank, brokerage, etc.).\n\nIf you don’t recall receiving a hard copy of a tax form in the mail, check your email and your online accounts — a document may have been sent to you electronically.\n\nHere are some of the tax forms you may have received:\n\nW-2 from your wage or salaried jobs\n\nfrom your wage or salaried jobs 1099-B for capital gains and losses on your investments\n\nfor capital gains and losses on your investments 1099-DIV from your brokerage or company where you own stock for dividends or other distributions from their investments\n\nfrom your brokerage or company where you own stock for dividends or other distributions from their investments 1099-INT for interest over $10 on your savings at a financial institution\n\nfor interest over $10 on your savings at a financial institution 1099-NEC from your clients, if you worked as a contractor\n\nfrom your clients, if you worked as a contractor 1099-K for payments for goods and services through third-party platforms like Venmo, CashApp or Etsy. The 1099-K is required if you made more than $20,000 in over 200 transactions during the year. (Next year the reporting threshold drops to $600.) But even if you didn’t get a 1099-K you still must report all the income that you made over third-party platforms in 2022.\n\nfor payments for goods and services through third-party platforms like Venmo, CashApp or Etsy. The 1099-K is required if you made more than $20,000 in over 200 transactions during the year. (Next year the reporting threshold drops to $600.) But even if you didn’t get a 1099-K you still must report all the income that you made over third-party platforms in 2022. 1099-Rs for distributions over $10 that you received for a pension, annuity, retirement account, profit-sharing plan or insurance contract\n\nfor distributions over $10 that you received for a pension, annuity, retirement account, profit-sharing plan or insurance contract SSA-1099 or SSA-1042S for Social Security benefits received.\n\n“Be aware that there’s no form for some taxable income, like proceeds from renting out your vacation property, meaning you’re responsible for reporting it on your own,” according to the Illinois CPA Society.\n\nOne very last-minute way to reduce your 2022 tax bill: If you’re eligible to make a tax-deductible contribution to an IRA and haven’t done so for last year, you have until April 18 to contribute up to $6,000 ($7,000 if you’re 50 or older). That will reduce your tax bill and augment your retirement savings.\n\nProofread your return before submitting it: Do this whether you’re using tax software or working with a professional tax preparer.\n\nLittle mistakes and oversights delay the processing of your return (and the issuance of your refund if you’re owed one). You want to avoid things like having a typo in your name, birth date, Social Security number or direct deposit number; choosing the wrong filing status (e.g., married vs single); making a simple math error; or leaving a required field blank.\n\nWhat to do if you can’t file by April 18: If you’re not able to file by next Tuesday, fill out Form 4868 electronically or on paper and send it in by April 18. You will be granted an automatic six-month extension to file.\n\nNote, however, that an extension to file is not an extension to pay. You will be charged interest (currently running at 7%) and a penalty on any amount you still owe for 2022 but haven’t paid by April 18.\n\nSo if you suspect you still owe tax — perhaps you had some income outside of your job for which tax wasn’t withheld or you had a big capital gain last year — approximate how much more you owe and send that money to the IRS by Tuesday.\n\nYou can choose to do so by mail, attaching a check to your extension request form. Make sure your envelope is postmarked no later than April 18.\n\nOr the more efficient route is pay what you owe electronically at IRS.gov, said CPA Damien Martin, a tax partner at EY. If you do that, the IRS notes you will not have to file a Form 4868. “The IRS will automatically process an extension of time to file,” the agency notes in its instructions.\n\nIf you opt to electronically pay directly from your bank account, which is free, select “extension” and then “tax year 2022” when given the option.\n\nYou can also pay by credit or debit card, but you will be charged a processing fee. Doing so, though, may become much more costly than just a fee if you charge your tax payment but don’t pay your credit card bill off in full every month, since you likely pay a high interest rate on outstanding balances.\n\nIf you still owe income taxes to your state, remember that you may need to go through a similar exercise of filing for an extension and making a payment to your state’s revenue department, Martin said.\n\nUse this interactive tax assistant for basic questions you may have: The IRS provides an “interactive tax assistant” that can help you answer more than 50 basic questions pertaining to your individual circumstance on income, deductions, credits and other technical questions.",

    "summary": "Washington, DC CNN — Spending at US retailers fell in March as consumers pulled back after the banking crisis fueled recession fears.",
    "text": "Washington, DC CNN —\n\nSpending at US retailers fell in March as consumers pulled back after the banking crisis fueled recession fears.\n\nRetail sales, which are adjusted for seasonality but not for inflation, fell by 1% in March from the prior month, the Commerce Department reported on Friday. That was steeper than an expected 0.4% decline, according to Refinitiv, and above the revised 0.2% decline in the prior month.\n\nInvestors chalk up some of the weakness to a lack of tax returns and concerns about a slowing labor market. The IRS issued $84 billion in tax refunds this March, about $25 billion less than they issued in March of 2022, according to BofA analysts.\n\nThat led consumers to pull back in spending at department stores and on durable goods, such as appliances and furniture. Spending at general merchandise stores fell 3% in March from the prior month and spending at gas stations declined 5.5% during the same period. Excluding gas station sales, retail spending retreated 0.6% in March from February.\n\nHowever, retail spending rose 2.9% year-over-year.\n\nThe effect of smaller tax returns\n\nSmaller tax returns likely played a role in last month’s decline in retail sales, along with the expiration of enhanced food assistance benefits, economists say.\n\n“March is a really important month for refunds. Some folks might have been expecting something similar to last year,” Aditya Bhave, senior US economist at BofA Global Research, told CNN.\n\nCredit and debit card spending per household tracked by Bank of America researchers moderated in March to its slowest pace in more than two years, which was likely the result of smaller returns and expired benefits, coupled with slowing wage growth.\n\nEnhanced pandemic-era benefits provided through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program expired in February, which might have also held back spending in March, according to a Bank of America Institute report.\n\nA slowing labor market\n\nAverage hourly earnings grew 4.2% in March from a year earlier, down from the prior month’s annualized 4.6% increase and the smallest annual rise since June 2021, according to figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Employment Cost Index, a more comprehensive measure of wages, has also shown that worker pay gains have moderated this past year. ECI data for the first quarter of this year will be released later this month.\n\nStill, the US labor market remains solid, even though it has lost momentum recently. That could hold up consumer spending in the coming months, said Michelle Meyer, North America chief economist at Mastercard Economics Institute.\n\n“The big picture is still favorable for the consumer when you think about their income growth, their balance sheet and the health of the labor market,” Meyer said.\n\nEmployers added 236,000 jobs in March, a robust gain by historical standards but smaller than the average monthly pace of job growth in the prior six months, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The latest monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report, showed that the number of available jobs remained elevated in February — but was down more than 17% from its peak of 12 million in March 2022, and revised data showed that weekly claims for US unemployment benefits were higher than previously reported.\n\nThe job market could cool further in the coming months. Economists at the Federal Reserve expect the US economy to head into a recession later in the year as the lagged effects of higher interest rates take a deeper hold. Fed economists had forecast subdued growth, with risks of a recession, prior to the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.\n\nFor consumers, the effects of last month’s turbulence in the banking industry have been limited so far. Consumer sentiment tracked by the University of Michigan worsened slightly in March during the bank failures, but it had already shown signs of deteriorating before then.\n\nThe latest consumer sentiment reading, released Friday morning, showed that sentiment held steady in April despite the banking crisis, but that higher gas prices helped push up year-ahead inflation expectations by a full percentage point, rising from 3.6% in March to 4.6% in April.\n\n“On net, consumers did not perceive material changes in the economic environment in April,” Joanne Hsu, director of the surveys of consumers at the University of Michigan, said in a news release.\n\n“Consumers are expecting a downturn, they’re not feeling as dismal as they were last summer, but they’re waiting for the other shoe to drop,” Hsu told Bloomberg TV in an interview Friday morning.\n\nThis story has been updated with context and more details.",

    "text": "CNN —\n\nThis is it.\n\nThe media defamation trial of the century is on the precipice of kicking off in Wilmington, Delaware, in just days.\n\nJury selection in Dominion Voting Systems’ monster $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit took place all of Thursday, with 300 potential jurors being summoned to court. Good progress was made and the presiding judge noted that there were “more than enough jurors” to start the trial as scheduled on Monday.\n\nIt is there, in Courtroom 7E, where the biggest figures in Murdoch Media, accompanied by a throng of high-powered lawyers, will attempt to mount their defense after repeatedly failing to convince a judge to toss the now-historic case.\n\nA version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here.\n\nIt’s, frankly, extraordinary to write those words. When I watched Fox News broadcast election lies in the aftermath of the 2020 election, never did I expect the network to be held accountable in a meaningful way.\n\nI’ve covered Fox News for a while now. I’ve watched thousands and thousands of hours of the right-wing channel’s programming. I’ve seen its hosts over the years undermine public health, make gross anti-immigrant remarks, peddle lies and propaganda and push deranged conspiracy theories that were once reserved for the right-wing’s furthest fringes.\n\nThe network has always seemed to find a way to sail through the controversy, even the most hellish storms it has faced. Sometimes it has emerged even stronger and more emboldened than before.\n\nBut this time is different. This time, the normal tricks the network turns to during times of crisis will not free it from trouble. This time, in a court of law, the network will need to put forward an honest, fact-driven argument.\n\nFox News is about to enter the true No Spin Zone, where deception is strictly prohibited. Where it is not in charge. And where its top executives like Rupert Murdoch and Suzanne Scott and hosts like Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity cannot simply ignore a request for comment and resort to, instead, attacking “the media” on-air.\n\nIn this setting, where lies cannot be casually told and truth cannot be distorted beyond reality to fit a dishonest narrative, it will be fascinating to see how the network fares. If the pre-trial hearings are any indicator, it won’t be pretty. The case hasn’t even started and the presiding judge has already lost his patience with Fox’s legal team and put them on notice.\n\nPerhaps the winds will shift for Fox News when the judge gavels in the trial on Monday. But if they play out like the last few weeks of court have, Fox News is in for a brutal ride.",

    "text": "CNN —\n\nWhen customers at Silicon Valley Bank rushed to withdraw billions of dollars last month, venture capitalist Arlan Hamilton stepped in to help some of the founders of color who panicked about losing access to payroll funds.\n\nAs a Black woman with nearly 10 years of business experience, Hamilton knew the options for those startup founders were limited.\n\nSVB had a reputation for servicing people from underrepresented communities like hers. Its failure has reignited concerns from industry experts about lending discrimination in the banking industry and the resulting disparities in capital for people of color.\n\nHamilton, the 43-year-old founder and managing partner of Backstage Capital, said that when it comes to entrepreneurs of color, “we’re already in the smaller house. We already have the rickety door and the thinner walls. And so, when a tornado comes by, we’re going to get hit harder.”\n\nEstablished in 1983, the midsize California tech lender was America’s 16th largest bank at the end of 2022 before it collapsed on March 10. SVB provided banking services to nearly half of all venture-backed technology and life-sciences companies in the United States.\n\nHamilton, industry experts and other investors told CNN the bank was committed to fostering a community of minority entrepreneurs and provided them with both social and financial capital.\n\nA bank run took down Silicon Valley Bank on March 10, as depositors withdrew $42 billion in a single day. Jeff Chiu/AP\n\nSVB regularly sponsored conferences and networking events for minority entrepreneurs, said Hamilton, and it was well known for funding the annual State of Black Venture Report spearheaded by BLK VC, a nonprofit organization that connects and empowers Black investors.\n\n“When other banks were saying no, SVB would say yes,” said Joynicole Martinez, a 25-year entrepreneur and chief advancement and innovation officer for Rising Tide Capital, a nonprofit organization founded in 2004 to connect entrepreneurs with investors and mentors.\n\nMartinez is also an official member of the Forbes Coaches Council, an invitation-only organization for business and career coaches. She said SVB was an invaluable resource for entrepreneurs of color and offered their clients discounted tech tools and research funding.\n\nMany women and people of color say they are turned away\n\nMinority business owners have long faced challenges accessing capital due to discriminatory lending practices, experts say. Data from the Small Business Credit Survey, a collaboration of all 12 Federal Reserve banks, shows disparities on denial rates for bank and nonbank loans.\n\nIn 2021, about 16% of Black-led companies acquired the total amount of business financing they sought from banks, compared to 35% of White-owned companies, the survey shows.\n\n“We know there’s historic, systemic, and just blatant racism that’s inherent in lending and banking. We have to start there and not tip-toe around it,” Martinez told CNN.\n\nAsya Bradley is an immigrant founder of multiple tech companies like Kinley, a financial services business aiming to help Black Americans build generational wealth. Following SVB’s collapse, Bradley said she joined a WhatsApp group of more than 1,000 immigrant business founders. Members of the group quickly mobilized to support one another, she said.\n\nImmigrant founders often don’t have Social Security numbers nor permanent addresses in the United States, Bradley said, and it was crucial to brainstorm different ways to find funding in a system that doesn’t recognize them.\n\n“The community was really special because a lot of these folks then were sharing different things that they had done to achieve success in terms of getting accounts in different places. They also were able to share different regional banks that have stood up and been like, ‘Hey, if you have accounts at SVB, we can help you guys,’” Bradley said.\n\nMany women, people of color and immigrants opt for community or regional banks like SVB, Bradley says, because they are often rejected from the “top four banks” — JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citibank.\n\nIn her case, Bradley said her gender might have been an issue when she could only open a business account at one of the “top four banks” when her brother co-signed for her.\n\n“The top four don’t want our business. The top four are rejecting us consistently. The top four do not give us the service that we deserve. And that’s why we’ve gone to community banks and regional banks such as SVB,” Bradley said.\n\nNone of the top four banks provided a comment to CNN. The Financial Services Forum, an organization representing the eight largest financial institutions in the United States has said the banks have committed millions of dollars since 2020 to address economic and racial inequality.\n\nLast week, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told CNN’s Poppy Harlow that his bank has 30% of its branches in lower-income neighborhoods as part of a $30 billion commitment to Black and Brown communities across the country.\n\nWells Fargo specifically pointed to its 2022 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion report, which discusses the bank’s recent initiatives to reach underserved communities.\n\nThe bank partnered last year with the Black Economic Alliance to initiate the Black Entrepreneur Fund — a $50 million seed, startup, and early-stage capital fund for businesses founded or led by Black and African American entrepreneurs. And since May 2021, Wells Fargo has invested in 13 Minority Depository Institutions, fulfilling its $50 million pledge to support Black-owned banks.\n\nBlack-owned banks work to close the lending gap and foster economic empowerment in these traditionally excluded communities, but their numbers have been dwindling over the years, and they have far fewer assets at their disposal than the top banks.\n\nOneUnited Bank, the largest Black-owned bank in the United States, manages a little over $650 million in assets. By comparison, JPMorgan Chase manages $3.7 trillion in assets.\n\nSVB’s collapse could spark future change, entrepreneur says\n\nBecause of these disparities, entrepreneurs also seek funding from venture capitalists. In the early 2010s, Hamilton intended to start her own tech company — but as she searched for investors, she saw that White men control nearly all venture capital dollars. That experience led her to establish Backstage Capital, a venture capital fund that invests in new companies led by underrepresented founders.\n\n“I said, ‘Well, instead of trying to raise money for one company, let me try to raise for a venture fund that will invest in underrepresented — and now we call them underestimated — founders who are women, people of color, and LGBTQ specifically,’ because I am all three,” Hamilton told CNN.\n\nSince then, Backstage Capital has amassed a portfolio of nearly 150 different companies and has made over 120 diversity investments, according to data from Crunchbase.\n\nBut Bradley, who is also an ‘angel investor’ of minority-owned businesses, said she remains “really hopeful” that community banks, regional banks and fintechs “will all stand up and say, ‘Hey, we are not going to let the good work of SVB go to waste.’”",

    "text": "CNN —\n\nLake Powell, the second-largest human-made reservoir in the US, has lost nearly 7% of its potential storage capacity since 1963, when Glen Canyon Dam was built, a new report shows.\n\nIn addition to water loss due to an intense multiyear drought, the US Geological Survey and the Bureau of Reclamation report found, Lake Powell faced an average annual loss in storage capacity of about 33,270 acre-feet, or 11 billion gallons, per year between 1963 and 2018.\n\nThat’s enough water to fill the Reflecting Pool on the National Mall about 1,600 times.\n\nThe capacity of the reservoir is shrinking because of sediments flowing in from the Colorado and San Juan rivers, according to the report. Those sediments settle at the bottom of the reservoir and decrease the total amount of water the reservoir can hold.\n\nAs of Monday, Lake Powell was around 25% full, according to data from the Bureau of Reclamation.\n\nIt’s bad news for a region already facing water shortages and extreme wildfires due to the drought. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration drought experts said last week these conditions are expected to at least continue – if not worsen – in the coming months.\n\nLake Powell is an important reservoir in the Colorado River Basin. Both Lake Powell and nearby Lake Mead, the nation’s largest reservoir, have drained at an alarming rate. In August, the federal government declared a water shortage on the Colorado River for the first time after Lake Mead’s water level plunged to unprecedented lows, triggering mandatory water consumption cuts for states in the Southwest that began in January.\n\nAnd last week, Lake Powell dipped below the critical threshold of 3,525 feet above sea level, sparking additional concerns about water supply and hydropower generation millions of people in the West rely on for electricity.\n\nThe significance of the dwindling water supply along the Colorado cannot be overstated.\n\nThe system supplies water for more than 40 million people living across seven Western states and Mexico. Lakes Powell and Mead provide a critical supply of drinking water and irrigation for many across the region, including rural farms, ranches and native communities.\n\n“It is vitally important we have the best-available scientific information like this report to provide a clear understanding of water availability in Lake Powell as we plan for the future,” Tanya Trujillo, assistant secretary for water and science with the US Department of Interior, said in a statement. “The Colorado River system faces multiple challenges, including the effects of a 22-year-long drought and the increased impacts of climate change.”",

    "summary": "CNN — Air pollution spiked to unhealthy levels around the world in 2021, according to a new report.",
    "text": "CNN —\n\nAir pollution spiked to unhealthy levels around the world in 2021, according to a new report.\n\nThe report by IQAir, a company that tracks global air quality, found that average annual air pollution in every country — and 97% of cities — exceeded the World Health Organization’s air quality guidelines, which were designed to help governments craft regulations to protect public health.\n\nOnly 222 cities of the 6,475 analyzed had average air quality that met WHO’s standard. Three territories were found to have met WHO guidelines: the French territory of New Caledonia and the United States territories of Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.\n\nIndia, Pakistan and Bangladesh were among the countries with the worst air pollution, exceeding the guidelines by at least 10 times.\n\nThe Scandinavian countries, Australia, Canada, Japan and United Kingdom ranked among the best countries for air quality, with average levels that exceeded the guidelines by 1 to 2 times.\n\nIn the United States, IQAir found air pollution exceeded WHO guidelines by 2 to 3 times in 2021.\n\n“This report underscores the need for governments around the world to help reduce global air pollution,” Glory Dolphin Hammes, CEO of IQAir North America, told CNN. “(Fine particulate matter) kills far too many people every year and governments need to set more stringent air quality national standards and explore better foreign policies that promote better air quality.”\n\nIQAir\n\nAbove: IQAir analyzed average annual air quality for more than 6,000 cities and categorized them from best air quality, in blue (Meets WHO PM2.5 guildline) to worst, in purple (Exceeds WHO PM2.5 guideline by over 10 times). An interactive map is available from IQAir.\n\nIt’s the first major global air quality report based on WHO’s new annual air pollution guidelines, which were updated in September 2021. The new guidelines halved the acceptable concentration of fine particulate matter — or PM 2.5 — from 10 down to 5 micrograms per cubic meter.\n\nPM 2.5 is the tiniest pollutant yet also among the most dangerous. When inhaled, it travels deep into lung tissue where it can enter the bloodstream. It comes from sources like the burning of fossil fuels, dust storms and wildfires, and has been linked to a number of health threats including asthma, heart disease and other respiratory illnesses.\n\nMillions of people die each year from air quality issues. In 2016, around 4.2 million premature deaths were associated with fine particulate matter, according to WHO. If the 2021 guidelines had been applied that year, WHO found there could have been nearly 3.3 million fewer pollution-related deaths.\n\nIQAir analyzed pollution-monitoring stations in 6,475 cities across 117 countries, regions and territories.\n\nIn the US, air pollution spiked in 2021 compared to 2020. Out of the more than 2,400 US cities analyzed, Los Angeles air remained the most polluted, despite seeing a 6% decrease compared to 2020. Atlanta and Minneapolis saw significant increases in pollution, the report showed.\n\n“The (United States’) reliance on fossil fuels, increasing severity of wildfires as well as varying enforcement of the Clean Air Act from administration to administration have all added to U.S. air pollution,” the authors wrote.\n\nResearchers say the main sources of pollution in the US were fossil fuel-powered transportation, energy production and wildfires, which wreak havoc on the country’s most vulnerable and marginalized communities.\n\n“We are heavily dependent on fossil fuels, especially in terms of transportation,” said Hammes, who lives a few miles from Los Angeles. “We can act smartly on this with zero emissions, but we’re still not doing it. And this is having a devastating impact on the air pollution that we’re seeing in major cities.”\n\nClimate change-fueled wildfires played a significant role in reducing air quality in the US in 2021. The authors pointed to a number of fires that led to hazardous air pollution — including the Caldor and Dixie fires in California, as well as the Bootleg Fire in Oregon, which wafted smoke all the way to the East Coast in July.\n\nChina — which is among the countries with the worst air pollution — showed improved air quality in 2021. More than half of the Chinese cities analyzed in the report saw lower levels of air pollution compared to the previous year. The capital city of Beijing continued a five-year trend of improved air quality, according to the report, due to a policy-driven drawdown of polluting industries in the city.\n\nThe report also found that the Amazon Rainforest, which had acted as the world’s major defender against the climate crisis, emitted more carbon dioxide than it absorbed last year. Deforestation and wildfires have threatened the critical ecosystem, polluted the air and contributed to climate change.\n\n“This is all a part of the formula that will lead to or is leading to global warming.” Hammes said.\n\nThe report also unveiled some inequalities: Monitoring stations remain scant in some developing countries in Africa, South America and the Middle East, resulting in a dearth of air quality data in those regions.\n\n“When you don’t have that data, you’re really in the dark,” Hammes said.\n\nHammes noted the African country of Chad was included in the report for the first time, due to an improvement in its monitoring network. IQAir found the country’s air pollution was the second-highest in the world last year, behind Bangladesh.\n\nTarik Benmarhnia, a climate change epidemiologist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography who has studied the health impact of wildfire smoke, also noted that relying only on monitoring stations can lead to blind spots in these reports.\n\n“I think it is great that they relied on different networks and not only governmental sources,” Benmarhnia, who was not involved in this report, told CNN. “However, many regions do not have enough stations and alternative techniques exist.”\n\nThe UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded in its 2021 report that, in addition to slowing the speed of global warming, curbing the use of fossil fuels would have the added benefit of improving air quality and public health.\n\nHammes said the IQAir report is even more reason for the world to wean off fossil fuel.\n\n“We’ve got the report, we can read it, we can internalize it and really devote ourselves to taking action,” she said. “There needs to be a major move towards renewable energy. We need to take drastic action in order to reverse the tide of global warming; otherwise, the impact and the train that we’re on (would be) irreversible.”",

    "text": "CNN —\n\nAs the US attempts to wean itself off its heavy reliance on fossil fuels and shift to cleaner energy sources, many experts are eyeing a promising solution: your neighborhood big-box stores and shopping malls.\n\nThe rooftops and parking lot space available at retail giants like Walmart, Target and Costco is massive. And these largely empty spaces are being touted as untapped potential for solar power that could help the US reduce its dependency on foreign energy, slash planet-warming emissions and save companies millions of dollars in the process.\n\nAt the IKEA store in Baltimore, installing solar panels on the roof and over the store’s parking lot cut the amount of energy it needed to purchase by 84%, slashing its costs by 57% from September to December of 2020, according to the company. (The panels also provide some beneficial shade to keep customers’ cars cool on hot, sunny days.)\n\nAs of February 2021, IKEA had 54 solar arrays installed across 90% of its US locations.\n\nBig-box stores and shopping centers have enough roof space to produce half of their annual electricity needs from solar, according to a report from nonprofit Environment America and research firm Frontier Group.\n\nLeveraging the full rooftop solar potential of these superstores would generate enough electricity to power nearly 8 million average homes, the report concluded, and would cut the same amount of planet-warming emissions as pulling 11.3 million gas-powered cars off the road.\n\nThe average Walmart store, for example, has 180,000 square feet of rooftop, according to the report. That’s roughly the size of three football fields and enough space to support solar energy that could power the equivalent of 200 homes, the report said.\n\n“Every rooftop in America that isn’t producing solar energy is a rooftop wasted as we work to break our dependence on fossil fuels and the geopolitical conflicts that come with them,” Johanna Neumann, senior director for Environment America’s campaign for 100% Renewable, told CNN. “Now is the time to lean into local renewable energy production, and there’s no better place than the roofs of America’s big-box superstores.”\n\nJudson Jones, CNN\n\nAdvocates involved in clean energy worker-training programs tell CNN that a solar revolution in big-box retail would also be a significant windfall for local communities, spurring economic growth while tackling the climate crisis, which has inflicted disproportionate harm on marginalized communities.\n\nYet only a fraction of big-box stores in the US have solar on their rooftops or solar canopies in parking lots, the report’s authors told CNN.\n\nCNN reached out to five of the top US retailers — Walmart, Kroger, Home Depot, Costco and Target — to ask: Why not invest in more rooftop solar?\n\nMany renewable energy experts point to solar as a relatively simple solution to cut down on costs and help rein in fossil fuel emissions, but the companies point to several roadblocks — regulations, labor costs and structural integrity of the rooftops themselves — that are preventing more widespread adoption.\n\nThe need for these kinds of clean energy initiatives is becoming “unquestionably urgent” as the climate crisis accelerates, said Edwin Cowen, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Cornell University.\n\n“We are behind the eight ball, to put it mildly,” Cowen told CNN. “I would have loved to see policy help incentivize rooftop solar 15 years ago instead of five years ago in the commercial space. There’s still a tremendous amount of work to do.”\n\nWhat’s the holdup?\n\nNeumann said Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, possesses by far the largest solar potential. Walmart has around 5,000 stores in the US and more than 783 million square feet of rooftop space — an area larger than Manhattan — and more than 8,974 gigawatt hours of annual rooftop solar potential, according to the report.\n\nIt’s enough electricity to power more than 842,000 homes, the report said.\n\n“Every rooftop in America that isn’t producing solar energy is a rooftop wasted as we work to break our dependence on fossil fuels and the geopolitical conflicts that come with them.” Johanna Neumann, Environment America\n\nWalmart spokesperson Mariel Messier told CNN the company is involved in renewable energy projects around the world, but many of them are not rooftop solar installations. The company has reported having completed on- and off-site wind and solar projects or had others under development with a capacity to produce more than 2.3 gigawatts of renewable energy.\n\nNeumann said Environment America has met with Walmart a few times, urging the retailer to commit to installing solar panels on roofs and in parking lots. The company has said it’s aiming to source 100% of its energy through renewable projects by 2035.\n\n“Of all the retailers in America, Walmart stands to make the biggest impact if they put rooftop solar on all of their stores,” Neumann told CNN. “And for us, this report just underscores just how much of an impact they could make if they make that decision.”\n\nAccording to Environment America, Walmart had installed almost 194 megawatts of solar capacity on its US facilities as of the end of the 2021 fiscal year and additional capacity in off-site solar farms. The company’s installations in California were expected to provide between 20% to 30% of each location’s electricity needs.\n\nSolar panels on the roof of a Target store in Inglewood, California, in 2020. Target ranked No. 1 for on-site solar capacity in 2019, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. Kirby Lee/AP\n\nTarget ranked No. 1 for on-site solar capacity in 2019, according to industry trade group Solar Energy Industries Association’s most recent report. It currently has 542 locations with rooftop solar — around a quarter of the company’s stores — a Target spokesperson told CNN. Rooftop solar generates enough energy to meet 15% to 40% of Target properties’ energy needs, the spokesperson said.\n\nRichard Galanti, the chief financial officer at Costco, said the company has 121 stores with rooftop solar around the world, 95 of which are in the US.\n\nWalmart, Target and Costco did not share with CNN what their biggest barriers are to adding rooftop or parking lot solar panels to more stores.\n\nApproximate number of households companies could power with rooftop solar Walmart — 842,700 Target — 259,900 Home Depot — 256,600 Kroger — 192,500 Costco — 87,500 Source: Environment America, Frontier Group report, “Solar on Superstores”\n\n“My suspicion is that they want an even stronger business case for deviating from business-as-usual,” Neumann said. “Historically, all those roofs have done is cover their stores, and rethinking how [they] use their buildings and thinking of them as energy generators, not just protection from rain, requires a small change in their business model.”\n\nHome Depot, which has around 2,300 stores, currently has 75 completed rooftop solar projects, 12 in construction and more than 30 planned for future development, said Craig D’Arcy, the company’s director of energy management. Solar power generates around half of these stores’ energy needs on average, he said.\n\nAging rooftops at stores are a “huge impediment” to solar installation, D’Arcy added. If a roof needs to be replaced in the next 15 to 20 years or sooner, it doesn’t make financial sense for Home Depot to add solar systems today, he said.\n\n“We have a goal of implementing solar rooftop where the economics are attractive,” D’Arcy told CNN.\n\nCNN also reached out to Kroger, which owns about 2,800 stores across the US. Kristal Howard, a Kroger spokesperson, said the company currently has 15 properties — stores, distribution centers and manufacturing plants — with solar installations. One of the “multiple factors affecting the viability of a solar installation” was the stores’ ability to support a solar installation on the roofs, Howard said.\n\nA worker walks among solar panels being installed on the roof of an IKEA in Miami in 2014. As of February, IKEA had solar installed at 90% of its US locations. J Pat Carter/AP\n\nCowen, the engineering professor at Cornell, said solar is already attractive, but that labor costs, incentives and the different layers of regulation likely pose some financial challenges in solar installations.\n\n“For them, this means usually hiring a local site firm that can do that installation that also knows local policy,” Cowen said. “It’s just another layer of complexity that I think is beginning to make sense because the costs have come down enough, but it needs kind of reopening that door of getting into an existing building.”\n\nRep. Sean Casten of Illinois, who co-chairs the power sector task force in the House, said the US has “failed to provide the incentives to people who have the expertise to go in and build these things.” The reason both retail companies and the power sector have not made much progress on solar is because “our system is so disjointed” and has a complex regulation structure, Casten said.\n\n“Why aren’t we doing something that makes economic sense? The answer is this horribly disjointed federal policy where we massively subsidize fossil energy extraction, and we penalize clean energy production,” Casten told CNN. “For a long, long time, if you wanted to build a solar panel on the rooftop of Walmart, your biggest enemy was going to be your local utility because they didn’t want to lose the load.\n\n“We could have done this decades ago,” Casten added. “And had we done it, we would not be in this dire position with the climate, but we’d also have a lot more money in our pocket.”\n\nActing on climate, equitably\n\nFor Charles Callaway, director of organizing at the nonprofit group WE ACT for Environmental Justice, strengthening the rooftop solar capacity in big box retail stores is a no-brainer, especially if companies allow the local community to reap benefits either through installation jobs or sharing the electricity produced later.\n\nEither way, it would put a massive dent in curbing the climate crisis and help usher in an equitable transition away from fossil fuels — and it’s doable, Callaway told CNN.\n\nSolar panels on the roof of a Costco store in Ingelwood, California, in 2021. Costco told CNN 95 stores in the US have rooftop solar installations. Kirby Lee/AP\n\nThe New York City resident led a worker training program that helped train more than 100 local community members, mostly people of color, to become solar installers. He also formed a solar workers cooperative to ensure many of the participants of the training program get jobs in a tough market.\n\nIn the last two years, Callaway said his group has not only installed solar panels on roofs of affordable housing units, but also equipment capable of producing 2 megawatts of solar energy on shopping malls up in upstate New York. He emphasized that hiring locally would be most beneficial since local installers know the community and local regulations best.\n\n“One of my huge concerns is social equity,” Cowen said. “Access to renewable energy is a fairly privileged position these days, and we’ve got to figure out ways to make that not true.”\n\nJasmine Graham, WE ACT’s energy justice policy manager, said the potential of building rooftop solar on big box superstores is encouraging, only “if these projects use local labor, if they are paying prevailing wages, and if this solar is being used in a manner such as community solar, which would allow [utility] bill discounts for folks that live in the same utility zone.”\n\nPressure is mounting for global leaders to act urgently on the climate crisis after a UN report in late February warned the window for action is rapidly closing.\n\nNeumann believes the US can meet its energy demand with renewables. All it takes, she said, is the political will to make that switch, and the inclusion of the local community so no one gets left behind in the transition.\n\n“The sooner we make that transition, the sooner we’ll have cleaner air, the sooner we’ll have a more protected environment and better health and the sooner we’ll have a more livable future for our kids,” Neumann said. “And even if that requires investment, it is an investment worth making.”",

    "text": "Editor’s Note: Featuring the good, the bad and the ugly, ‘Look of the Week’ is a regular series dedicated to unpacking the most talked about outfit of the last seven days.\n\nCNN —\n\nBringing the second day of this year’s Coachella to a close, K-Pop girl group Blackpink made history Saturday night when they became the first Asian act to ever headline the festival. To a crowd of, reportedly, over 125,000 people, Jennie, Jisoo, Lisa and Rosé used the ground-breaking moment to pay homage to Korean heritage by arriving onstage in hanboks: a traditional type of dress.\n\nWhile the garments were shrugged off a few seconds into their opening track, “Pink Venom,” revealing each member’s custom black and pink Dolce and Gabbana outfit, fans across the world had already received the message. Screenshots of the moment quickly spread among Blackpink superfans, otherwise known as Blinks. “The way they stepped onto the biggest western stage in hanboks … literally proved their place at the top of the industry,” tweeted one Blink. “Blackpink really are in a league of their own.”\n\nDesigned by OUWR and Kumdanje, the hanboks were inspired by the Cheol-lik silhouette. Kumdanje/OUW\n\nAnother called the group “Korea’s cultural delegation” on Instagram, in reference to not only the hanboks but other visual cues incorporated into their show, such as one of the stage backdrops featuring an angular tiled roof reminiscent of traditional Korean architecture.\n\nIn recent years, Blackpink have enjoyed a meteoric rise to global fame. According to Guinness World Records, they are currently the most streamed female group on Spotify, and have the most-viewed music YouTube channel. Last year, they were the first female K-Pop group to reach number 1 in the UK and US album charts, and in 2020 their track “How You Like That” became the most viewed video on YouTube in 24 hours. (The group also wore modernized hanboks, designed by Kim Danha, in one of the music video’s scenes.) Their landmark set over the weekend was in fact a follow-up to another milestone: In 2019, they became the first female K-Pop group to ever play at Coachella or any other US festival.\n\nFrom the iconic Jean Paul Gaultier cone bra worn by Madonna for her 1990 Blond Ambition tour to Geri “Ginger Spice” Halliwell’s Union Jack mini dress, the right stage costume can live on forever in public memory. Particularly when worn at a career-defining moment. During another watershed Coachella performance — Beyonce’s 2018 headline set — the singer’s custom Balmain collegiate-style yellow hoodie was a joyful nod to Black culture, specifically historically Black colleagues and universities.\n\nThe group’s four black hanboks were custom created by South Korean pattern design brand OUWR and traditional Korean dressmakers Kumdanje. Inspired by the Cheol-lik silhouette, each garment was hand-embroidered with metallic traditional Korean motifs, including dan-cheong patterns and peonies (a symbol of royalty in Korea). “It was our pleasure and such an honor to be able to show the beautiful values of Korea and Hanbok together,” the designers wrote in a combined Instagram post. “Blackpink showed the beauty of Korea and dazzled the world.”\n\nThe stage design was another acknowledgement of Korean heritage. Frazer Harrison/Getty Images\n\nIn Korea, hanboks are still worn for special occasions and often seen on TV dramas. Many designers in the country have also created contemporary takes that are incorporated into everyday wear. At Seoul Fashion Week, JULYCOLUMN’s Fall-Winter 2023 collection drew on the hanbok’s voluminous silhouette to create shirts and structured jackets. Last September, Korean label BlueTamburin brought the garment to a Western audience by exclusively using traditional hanbok fabric to create its Spring-Summer 2023 collection at Milan Fashion Week.\n\nWhether you’re a devoted Blink or not, the looks marked a moment of Asian visibility, recognition of traditional craftsmanship and a powerful example of feeling seen through fashion — representing Korean culture and symbolically embracing both its past and future.\n\nAt the end of their performance, and having addressed the audience between numbers in English throughout their two-hour-long performance, Blackpink finished their set in Korean: “Until now, it has been Jennie, Jisoo, Lisa, and Rosé Blackpink. Thank you.”\n\nTop image: Blackpink performing at the first weekend of Coachella 2023, shortly after removing their hanboks.",

    "text": "Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\n“Old Masters” such as Leonardo da Vinci, Sandro Botticelli and Rembrandt may have used proteins, especially egg yolk, in their oil paintings, according to a new study.\n\nTrace quantities of protein residue have long been detected in classic oil paintings, though they were often ascribed to contamination. A new study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications found the inclusion was likely intentional — and sheds light on the technical knowledge of the Old Masters, the most skilled European painters of the 16th, 17th, or early 18th century, and the way they prepared their paints.\n\n“There are very few written sources about this and no scientific work has been done before to investigate the subject in such depth,” said study author Ophélie Ranquet of the Institute of Mechanical Process Engineering and Mechanics at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany, in a phone interview. “Our results show that even with a very small amount of egg yolk, you can achieve an amazing change of properties in the oil paint, demonstrating how it might have been beneficial for the artists.”\n\nSimply adding some egg yolk to their works, it turns out, could have long-lasting effects that went beyond just aesthetics.\n\nEggs vs. oil\n\nCompared with the medium formulated by ancient Egyptians called tempera — which combines egg yolk with powdered pigments and water — oil paint creates more intense colors, allows for very smooth color transitions and dries far less quickly, so it can be used for several days after its preparation. However, oil paint, which uses linseed or safflower oil instead of water, also has drawbacks, including being more susceptible to color darkening and damage caused by exposure to light.\n\nBecause making paint was an artisanal and experimental process, it is possible that the Old Masters might have added egg yolk, a familiar ingredient, to the newer type of paint, which first showed up in the seventh century in Central Asia before spreading to Northern Europe in the Middle Ages and Italy during the Renaissance. In the study, the researchers recreated the process of paint-making by using four ingredients — egg yolk, distilled water, linseed oil and pigment — to mix two historically popular and significant colors, lead white and ultramarine blue.\n\n“The addition of egg yolk is beneficial because it can tune the properties of these paints in a drastic way,” Ranquet said, “For example by showing aging differently: It takes a longer time for the paint to oxidize, because of the antioxidants contained in the yolk.”\n\nThe chemical reactions between the oil, the pigment and the proteins in the yolk directly affect the paint’s behavior and viscosity. “For example, the lead white pigment is quite sensitive to humidity, but if you coat it with a protein layer, it makes it a lot more resistant to it, making the paint quite easy to apply,” Ranquet said.\n\n“On the other hand, if you wanted something stiffer without having to add a lot of pigment, with a bit of egg yolk you can create a high impasto paint,” she added, referring to a painting technique where the paint is laid out in a stroke thick enough that the brushstrokes are still visible. Using less pigment would have been desirable centuries ago, when certain pigments — such as lapis lazuli, which was used to make ultramarine blue — were more expensive than gold, according to Ranquet.\n\n\"The Madonna of the Carnation,\" on display at the Alte Pinakothek in Munich, Germany, is one of Leonardo da Vinci's earliest paintings. Wrinkling of the oil paint is evident on the faces. DeAgostini/Getty Images\n\nA direct evidence of the effect of egg yolk in oil paint, or lack thereof, can be seen in Leonardo da Vinci’s “Madonna of the Carnation,” one of the paintings observed during the study. Currently on display at the Alte Pinakothek in Munich, Germany, the work shows evident wrinkling on the face of Mary and the child.\n\n“Oil paint starts to dry from the surface down, which is why it wrinkles,” Ranquet said.\n\nOne reason for wrinkling may be an insufficient quantity of pigments in the paint, and the study has shown that this effect could be avoided with the addition of egg yolk: “That’s quite amazing because you have the same quantity of pigment in your paint, but the presence of the egg yolk changes everything.”\n\nBecause wrinkling occurs within days, it’s likely that Leonardo and other Old Masters might have caught onto this particular effect, as well as additional beneficial properties of egg yolk in oil paint, including resistance to humidity. The “Madonna of Carnation” is one of Leonardo’s earliest paintings, created at a time when he might have been still trying to master the then newly popular medium of oil paint.\n\nNew understanding of the classics\n\nAnother painting observed during the study was “The Lamentation Over the Dead Christ,” by Botticelli, also on display at the Alte Pinakothek. The work is mostly made with tempera, but oil paint has been used for the background and some secondary elements.\n\n“We knew that some parts of the paintings show brushstrokes that are typical for what we call an oil painting, and yet we detected the presence of proteins,” Ranquet said. “Because it’s a very small quantity and they are difficult to detect, this might be dismissed as contamination: In workshops, artists used many different things, and maybe the eggs were just from the tempera.”\n\nHowever, because adding egg yolk had such desirable effects on oil paint, the presence of proteins in the work might be an indication of deliberate use instead, the study suggested. Ranquet hopes that these preliminary findings might attract more curiosity toward this understudied topic.\n\nMaria Perla Colombini, a professor of analytical chemistry at the University of Pisa in Italy, who was not involved in the study, agreed. “This exciting paper provides a new scenario for the understanding of old painting techniques,” she said in an email.\n\n“The research group, reporting results from molecular level up to a macroscopic scale, contributes to a new knowledge in the use of egg yolk and oil binders. They are not more looking at simply identifying the materials used by Old Masters but explain how they could produce wonderful and glittering effects by employing and mixing the few available natural materials. They try to discover the secrets of old recipes of which little or nothing is written,” she added.\n\n“This new knowledge contributes not only to a better conservation and preservation of artworks but also to a better comprehension of art history.”\n\n\n\nTop image: The “Mona Lisa” by Leonardo Da Vinci",

CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation.\n\nThe Conversation —\n\nHugh Hefner launched Playboy Magazine 70 years ago this year. The first issue included a nude photograph of Marilyn Monroe, which he had purchased and published without her knowledge or consent.\n\nHefner went on to build the Playboy brand off the backs of the countless women featured in its pages, whose beauty and performance of heightened feminine sexuality have entertained its readers for generations.\n\nApproaching its 70th anniversary in December, Playboy has radically shifted. With the magazine no longer in publication, the Playboy Mansion sold to a developer and London’s last remaining Playboy Club closing in 2021, what is the future for Playboy? The brand is changing to keep up with the post-#MeToo world.\n\nHefner passed away one month before allegations against film producer Harvey Weinstein surfaced in 2017 giving momentum to the #MeToo movement (which saw survivors of sexual assault and harassment speak out against their abusers).\n\nREAD MORE: Sex, love and companionship … with AI? Why human-machine relationships could go mainstream\n\nIn recent years, many have re-evaluated Hefner’s legacy and relationships with women. The 2022 docuseries “The Secrets of Playboy” (which aired on Channel 4 in the UK) detailed sexual misconduct accusations against Hefner from several ex-girlfriends, including model Sondra Theodore and TV personality Holly Madison.\n\nHugh Hefner and Pamela Anderson during Playboy's 50th Anniversary Celebration at New York Armory in New York City. Theo Wargo/WireImage/Getty Images\n\nHefner and Playboy’s relationship with women has been complicated. Playboy was an early supporter of abortion rights, helped fund the first rape kit and was at times an early proponent of inclusivity (for example featuring transgender model, Caroline “Tula” Cossey, in its June 1981 issue). But most women featured in Playboy have fit within a narrow beauty standard — thin, white, able-bodied and blonde.\n\nMeanwhile Hefner’s personal relationship with his much younger girlfriends reportedly followed patterns of control and emotional abuse. Ex-girlfriend Holly Madison described Hefner as treating her “like a glorified pet” in her 2015 memoir, “Down the Rabbit Hole.”\n\nHefner’s passing meant he evaded reckoning with the #MeToo movement. Playboy, however, responded, releasing a statement in which it affirmed support for the women featured in “The Secrets of Playboy” and called Hefner’s actions “abhorrent.”\n\nThe statement declared that the brand was no longer affiliated with the Hefner family and would be focusing on aspects of the company’s legacy that align with values of sex positivity and free expression.\n\nREAD MORE: The ‘milf’: a brief cultural history, from Mrs Robinson to Stifler’s mom\n\nToday, Playboy is a very different company from the one Hefner launched nearly 70 years ago. Roughly 80% of Playboy staff identify as women, according the company, and its motto has changed from “Entertainment for Men” to “Pleasure for All.” Shares in the company are publicly traded and 40% of its board and management are women.\n\nThe company has also moved towards more creator-led content through its app, Playboy Centerfold. Similar to subscription content service OnlyFans, Playboy Centerfold allows subscribers to view content from and interact with its creators, which it call “bunnies.”\n\nPlayboy \"bunnies\" in the West Indies, 1965. Daily Herald/Mirrorpix/Getty Images\n\nOn the app, creators — or bunnies — are able portray their own bodies however they wish, putting the power back in their hands. Perhaps Playboy’s future is no longer in serving the male gaze, but instead the very audience Hefner dismissed in his first letter from the editor:\n\n“If you’re a man between the ages of 18 and 80 Playboy is meant for you … If you’re somebody’s sister, wife or mother-in-law and picked us up by mistake, please pass us along to the man in your life and get back to your Ladies Home Companion.”\n\nThe bunnies next door\n\nThe stars of Playboy’s mid-2000s reality series, Holly Madison and Bridget Marquardt, are also enjoying a resurgence among fans.\n\n“The Girls Next Door” launched in 2004. The show focused on the lives of Hefner’s three girlfriends, Madison, Marquardt and Kendra Wilkinson. It became E’s best performing show and cultivated a new female audience for Playboy.\n\n“The Girls Next Door” was a story of complicated empowerment despite patriarchal interference. Its three female protagonists went from being known solely as some of Hefner’s many blonde girlfriends, to celebrities in their own right.\n\nThey each ultimately broke up with Hefner, leaving the Mansion and going on to lead successful careers.\n\nThe show’s depiction of Madison, Marquardt and Wilkinson as empowered, fun-loving and complex individuals, who found joy and agency through expressing their sexuality was perhaps what drew so many female fans to the show. However, amid the girls’ fight for agency, Hefner retaliated.\n\nBridget Marquardt and Hugh Hefner with Holly Madison and Kendra Wilkinson in 2008. Jeffrey Mayer/WireImage/Getty Images\n\nThe series shows that he maintained final say in every Playboy photograph of the girls, as well as imposing strict curfews and spending allowances.\n\nIn Madison and Wilkinson’s memoirs, “Down the Rabbit Hole,” and “Sliding into Home,” they claim that production consistently undermined them. They refused to pay them for the first season, didn’t credit them until season four and aired their uncensored nude bodies in foreign broadcasts and DVD releases without consent.\n\nREAD MORE: #MeToo in space: We must address the potential for sexual harassment and assault away from Earth\n\nFan interest in “The Girls Next Door” remains strong. In August 2022 Madison and Marquardt launched their podcast “Girls Next Level,” where they interview previous playmates and interact with fans. They also recap episodes from their own points of view, unpacking their experiences of working on the show.\n\nHaving reached 10 million downloads as of February 2023, the success of the podcast — 14 years after the last episode of “The Girls Next Door” — speaks to the cultural legacy of the Playboy brand. It also shows that despite Hefner’s original editor’s note, Playboy resonates with some women.\n\nPlayboy is now in a post-Hefner era, where the imagery of women found within old issues of Playboy can serve as inspiration for others to enjoy their own sexuality. Whatever the future has for the company, the concept of Playboy has become public property — be that in the appearance of Playboy bunny costumes each Halloween, the popularity of cheeky Playboy logo tattoos or branded lingerie and clothing.\n\nIn a post-#MeToo era, the women of Playboy are speaking up and taking over. With the mansion gates closed, the bunnies are finally reclaiming the brand as their own.\n\nCNN\n\nTop Image: Hugh Hefner with Playboy “bunnies” in London in 1966.",

    "text": "CNN —\n\nNow that the Fall-Winter 2023 catwalks have been disassembled, it’s clear one trend was more pervasive than any collective penchant for ruffles, pleated skirts or tailored coats.\n\nAcross runways in New York, London, Milan and Paris, there was a notable scarcity of plus-size models. This comes at a time when there are five injectable medications which can be used as appetite suppressants currently available by prescription in the US, stirring much conversation; a sixth medication, Rybelsus, is taken as an oral pill. Two are officially approved in the UK — the largest influx of weight loss medication seen in the country in almost a decade.\n\nIn recent months, injectables such as Wegovy and Ozempic — which share the same active ingredient, semaglutide — have been widely reported as Hollywood’s worst-kept weight loss secret. (Ozempic is intended for use primarily to treat Type 2 diabetes.) Comedian Chelsea Handler claimed her “anti-aging doctor just hands (Ozempic) out to anybody” while appearing on a podcast in January. Even Elon Musk tweeted last year about being on Wegovy.\n\nFor many fashion commentators and diversity advocates, the Fall-Winter 2023 runways were in sharp contrast to the (albeit limited) progress and heady promise of recent seasons. This rollback has been widely criticized in the style media as such. And its potential impact is being assessed more broadly: With the rise of these weight loss panaceas, the pursuit of size zero is now just a prescription away.\n\nThe Fall-Winter failings\n\nIn 2020, Jill Kortleve and Paloma Elsesser became the first models outside of a sample size to walk for the Italian fashion house Fendi. (Traditionally, a sample size falls between a US 0-4.) British label Erdem entered the plus-size market in 2021, extending its offering to a UK size 22 (or US size 18). And in January 2022, Valentino made headlines after its haute couture show featured a broad spectrum of body types. But this season, there was a visible lack of curve bodies on their runways — or many others.\n\nFendi and Valentino did not respond when contacted by CNN, while Erdem declined to comment.\n\nAccording to fashion search engine Tagwalk, the number of mid and plus-size models dropped by 24% in comparison to Spring-Summer 2023. Similarly, a size inclusivity report conducted by Vogue Business found that 95.6% of all looks presented for Fall-Winter 2023 were in a size US 0-4. For context, industry market firm Plunkett Research estimated in 2015 that 68% of American women wear a size US 14 or above.\n\nModels on the runway at Erdem's Fall-Winter 2023 show during London Fashion Week. Aitor Rosas Sune/WWD/Getty Images\n\n“It was a definitive backslide,” said IMG model agent Mina White, who represents plus-size and curve supermodels including Elsesser and Ashley Graham. “It was frustrating to see some of these designers not using curved bodies where they had in the past.” Fendi and Valentino did not respond when contacted by CNN, while Erdem declined to comment.\n\n“Watching somebody like Ashley Graham attend the front row for so many of these major houses in full looks (provided by the designer), it was frustrating,” White continued. “They wanted to utilize her image and her social following to command a certain space in the market, but they didn’t want to be reflective on their runways.”\n\nFor others, even the term “backslide” was too generous. “Slipping back from… what? A glorious time when the average American woman (size 16) was as present on the runways as she is in everyday life? A time when fashion ads cast as many ‘plus-size’ and ‘mid-size’ women as ‘straight-size’ women?” fashion journalist Amy Odell wrote in her Substack newsletter of this past season’s runways. “No one needed any data to understand that representing a wide array of body shapes and sizes in runway shows or in fashion imagery is not a priority for the industry.”\n\nThat said, a handful of — mostly smaller — brands pushed ahead this season. In London, emerging labels Di Petsa, Karoline Vitto and Sinead O’Dwyer showcased lineups of size-diverse models. Inclusivity at Christian Siriano, Coach, Kim Shui, Collina Strada and Bach Mai stood out in New York; while in Paris, Belgian brand Esther Manas — a consistent flag-bearer for size diversity — staged one of the city’s most refreshing runways with an assortment of fun, sensual, feminine looks that complimented a range of bodies.\n\nDuring Paris Fashion Week, Ester Manas staged one of the most size-inclusive runways this season. Richard Bord/Getty Images\n\nThere was also a smattering of mid- and plus-size castings to be seen elsewhere: Off-White and Michael Kors, for example, featured a few such models. At Harris Reed’s debut for Nina Ricci, Precious Lee opened the show — which also featured three more plus- and mid-size models.\n\nIt starts with sample size\n\nFashion samples and sample size pieces are one-off garments made before an item is mass-produced, typically to be worn during runway shows. Prioritizing the same body type in sample sizes means runway models are more easily interchangeable, saving fashion houses time and money if someone were to drop out or get sick during or after the casting process for a show.\n\nIt’s also partly why, according to White, casting curve models is still an uphill battle. She says she introduces brands to new faces months in advance of runway season, with their specific measurements up-top and easy to read in all correspondence. “I want to be ahead of that,” White said. “So I’m never told ‘Oh, we wanted to make it work, but we didn’t have her size’ or whatever that conversation might look like.”\n\nBut despite her efforts, she says she’s frequently told it’s too much of a “financial lift” to make larger samples — even by legacy brands. “I get very upset when brands say that,” White said. “I don’t believe that it is, I believe that it’s people not being properly educated on how to do this right.”\n\nA look from London-based brand Di Petsa's Fall-Winter 2023 collection. Aitor Rosas Sun/WWD/Getty Images\n\nBeyond the lack of representation, White notes it’s painful for plus-size consumers to watch brands leverage resources to create custom, made-to-fit pieces for celebrities — all the while claiming the pot is empty for more inclusive runway samples.\n\nLondon-based stylist and editor Francesca Burns agrees sample sizes are part of the problem. In 2020, Burns went viral after she posted on Instagram about a fashion job gone wrong. She says she was sent five looks to style from Celine, none of which fit the size UK 8 (US 4) model booked for the shoot— an 18-year-old on her first job in the business. The experience left her “horrified,” Burns told CNN, recalling what she saw as the model’s shame and embarrassment. “Looking into this girl’s eyes,” Burns said, “she shouldn’t have felt like that.”\n\nBurns’ post, which called the current system “unacceptable,” was picked up widely in the fashion media. (When reached by CNN, Celine declined to comment on the incident.) “Ultimately, the desire to see change has to be there,” Burns said. “And I wonder whether luxury has that desire?”\n\nA case for change\n\nProgress has been slow, but not entirely inexistent. Across fashion campaigns, magazine covers and editorial shoots, there is a growing enthusiasm for inclusivity. “I see the options rolling in for the plus-sized talent, and they’re great offerings,” said White. “Great, strong editorials and covers and campaigns. But I do feel like without the clothes, we are going to go back to see more naked curve stories, or lingerie curve stories or a curve girl in a trench coat. That’s what I don’t want.”\n\nFor British Vogue’s April issue, unveiled March 16, Elsesser, Lee and Jill Kortleve were dubbed “The New Supers.” Preceding the cover story is a letter written by editor-in-chief, Edward Enninful commending the models for “leading the way” and holding “powerful space” in the industry.\n\n“Catwalks are once again under scrutiny for a stark lack of body diversity,” read the magazine’s Instagram caption, unveiling the cover. “But this cover was not conceived as a statement. It is a crowning of an all-powerful trio, the supermodels for a new generation.”\n\nBut many online were quick to point out the disconnect: Two of the Saint Laurent Spring-Summer 2023 dresses were modeled by plus-size women, though they are not available to buy in most plus sizes.\n\nSee the full feature in the April issue of British Vogue available via digital download and on newsstands from March 21. Inez & Vinoodh/Vogue\n\nIn his own social media post, Enninful wrote about his disappointment at the Fall-Winter 2023 runways. “I thought I had gotten into a time machine. Show after show dominated by one body type, so many limited visions of womanhood… one prescribed notion of beauty prevailed again, and it felt like the reality of so many women around the world were being ignored.”\n\nBut for White, the power rests within the entire industry — not just at the feet of brands. “I really do believe there should be an industry standard between the (Council of Fashion Designers of America), the British Fashion Council and key editors at some of these major mass market magazines,” she continued. “If there was a call-to-action from these figureheads saying, moving forward samples need to be readily available for a few different body types, we would see significant and impactful change.”\n\nBurns agrees there must be a trickle-down effect. “I think a lot of responsibility is put on young designers to solve all these issues around sustainability or issues around body inclusivity,” she said. “It’s important that the big powerhouses, which have the capacity to action change, really take some responsibility.”\n\n‘No such thing as a free lunch’\n\nOn March 8, Wegovy — developed primarily as a treatment for those living with obesity and weight-related conditions — was approved in the UK. It’s the second injectable weight management medication to be made available with a prescription via the country’s National Health Service (NHS) in about 3 years, after almost a decade of quiet. Before 2020, the last weight loss medication was approved in the UK was in 2010.\n\nSimilarly, the US has now approved three weight management injections: Wegovy, Saxenda and IMCIVREE. Medications for type-2 diabetes like Mounjaro and Ozempic are not FDA-approved for weight loss, though some doctors are issuing them at their own discretion.\n\nWhile these medicines are a revolutionary tool for those who struggle to lose weight for genetic or medical reasons, they are at risk of being abused.\n\nSemaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy and Ozempic, was originally developed for treating type-2 diabetes. It quells hunger signals to the brain by mimicking the hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). “It can slow how quickly your stomach empties out and may give you a little more feeling of feeling full,” said Dr. Robert Lash, an endocrinologist and Chief Medical Officer of the Endocrine Society in Washington, D.C. In clinical trials, over a period of 68 weeks, participants who used the medication in conjunction with eating fewer calories and increasing their physical activity on average lost around 15% of their body weight compared to 2.4% of those using a placebo, according to the manufacturer Novo Nordisk.\n\nOn March 13, the European Medicines Agency issued a statement warning of an Ozempic shortage that could continue through the year, urging doctors to prioritize prescriptions to diabetics. “Any other use, including for weight management, represents off-label use and currently places the availability of Ozempic for the indicated population at risk,” read the release.\n\nPatients typically need a BMI of 27 or higher (along with another weight-related condition like high blood pressure or diabetes) or have a genetic predisposition towards obesity to be prescribed such appetite suppressant medication by their doctor. But talk of these injectables has been sweeping the West. In January, the New York Times reported on the term “Ozempic Face,” coined by a New York-based dermatologist who reported treating several patients with a hollowed-out appearance that can come with rapid weight loss. By the end of February, the medication had made it to the cover of New York Magazine in a feature titled “Life After Food?” Adverts for GLP-1 injections are even blanketing New York City subway stations.\n\nGLP-1 injections are now being marketed in New York City's subways. Courtesy Ro\n\nAnd across social media, online forums and private group chats, some people looking to lose weight for primarily aesthetic purposes are searching for a way to skirt the requirements.\n\n“I was just looking for a way to lose a few pounds, like 10 to 15 at most,” said one 30-year-old American woman, who wished to remain anonymous, in a phone interview. She scoured social media and forums for guidance on securing a weight loss drug. “I’m certainly a normal BMI, I just have a trip to Mexico coming up and I want to look really good,” she said.\n\nAlthough she says she found a way to access Wegovy, she decided against the medication after considering the cost (which can reach more than $1,000 a month without insurance). “I’ve always very much fit the societal standard but lately I was just like f*ck it, I want to be skinny,” she told CNN.\n\nDr. Lash emphasized the importance of taking weight loss drugs only with medical supervision and a valid prescription. “If somebody was a normal weight and they took this drug because they thought they could be even thinner than they are now, that could lead to complications,” he told CNN, warning of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and even gallbladder problems. “These drugs are not benign, they do have side effects involving the GI tract. There’s no such thing as a free lunch.”\n\nEvery body is invited\n\nFashion has long promoted size 0 as the ultimate virtue — regardless of its viability for many people, or any health risks. And now with the accessibility of accelerated weight loss medication, the stakes are even higher. For Burns and White, the industry is responsible for amplifying a new, more inclusive vision of beauty.\n\n“There’s a very archaic way of looking at women over a size 16 and just assuming that they’re unhealthy or uneducated or unstylish. Or don’t have the resources to buy into luxury,” said White. “The reality is the same women these brands are alienating in their fashion space are the same women running out to buy their handbags, shoes, perfumes, cosmetics and skincare.”\n\n\"Every body is invited,\" read the show notes for Ester Manas' Fall-Winter 2023 collection. Kay-Paris Fernandes/Getty Images\n\nNot only do designers need to create clothes with this consumer in mind, according to White, but they need to be seen on the runway, too.\n\n“It shouldn’t be a conversation. It should just be normalized that we’re not just looking at a single view of beauty,” echoed Burns.\n\nEster Manas and Balthazar Delepierre, whose bridal-inspired Fall-Winter 2023 collection was one of this season’s most size-diverse runways, summarized it best in their accompanying show notes: “The body is not the subject. Because, obviously, at a wedding, everybody is invited. And all to the party. That is where the designer duo Ester and Balthazar take their stand.”",

    "text": "Editor’s Note: This story was updated with the final sale price and other details following the auction.\n\nCNN —\n\nIn 1998, Michael Jordan laced up a pair of his iconic black and red Air Jordan 13s to bring home a Bulls victory during Game 2 of his final NBA championship — and now they are the most expensive sneakers ever to sell at auction.\n\n\n\nThe game-winning sneakers sold for $2.2 million at Sotheby’s in New York on Tuesday, smashing the sneaker auction record of $1.47 million, set in 2021 by a pair of Nike Air Ships that Jordan wore earlier in his career.\n\nThe sale arrives during “Jordan Year” — a reference to the NBA star player’s iconic jersey number 23. In January, Air Jordan partnered with Sotheby’s to auction off 13 pairs of retro sneakers that were designed in memory of The Notorious B.I.G. All lots outsold their high estimates of $5,000 by multiples, with the highest selling for more than $32,000.\n\nLast year, Jordan’s Game 1 jersey, also from the 1998 finals, became the most expensive item of worn sports memorabilia to sell at auction when it fetched $10.1 million at a Sotheby’s sale.\n\nJordan’s farewell run with the Chicago Bulls is often referred to as “The Last Dance,” after the title of an ESPN and Netflix documentary that chronicled the season. Jordan announced his (second) retirement weeks before the finals, leading to the six-game series against the Utah Jazz becoming the most-watched in NBA history, based on Nielsen TV ratings. (Jordan would later return from 2001 to 2003 to play with the Washington Wizards, but did not win another championship).\n\nMichael Jordan pictured wearing the record-breaking sneakers during the NBA Finals at the Delta Center in Salt Lake City, Utah, on June 05, 1998. Jeff Haynes/AFP/Getty Images/File\n\n“Michael Jordan game-worn sports memorabilia has proven time and time again to be the most elite and coveted items on the market,” said Brahm Wachter, Sotheby’s head of streetwear and modern collectables, in a press release prior to the sale. “However, items from his ‘Last Dance’ season are of a greater scale and magnitude as seen with our record-breaking sale of his Game 1 jersey in 2022.”\n\nThe pair of sneakers sold Tuesday were worn during Game 2, in Salt Lake City, which the Bulls won 93-88 after losing Game 1, with Jordan scoring 37 points. They are the last pair of black and red Air Jordan 13s that Jordan ever wore on the court for an NBA game, a press release from Sotheby’s noted.\n\nFollowing Game 2, Jordan signed and gifted the set of worn shoes to the ball boy in the visitor’s locker room, as he was known to do, according to Sotheby’s.\n\nThe Air Jordan 13 sneakers starred in a sports memorabilia sale called “Victoriam,” which featured items worn by athletes including Tom Brady, Kobe Bryant and Roger Federer. Several other Jordan items were included in the two-part auction, with a game-worn 1998 Bulls jersey and a pair of 1985 Air Jordan 1s fetching $508,000 and $127,000 respectively.\n\nOther top lots included one of Kobe Bryant’s LA Lakers shooting shirts, which sold for over $406,000, and a soccer jersey, worn by the late Pelé on his debut for the New York Cosmos in 1975, that sold fetched over $177,000.\n\nTop image: The Air Jordan 13 sneakers signed by Michael Jordan.",

    "text": "CNN —\n\nSome people travel the world in search of adventure, while others seek out natural wonders, cultural landmarks or culinary experiences. But French photographer François Prost was looking for something altogether different during his recent road trip across America: strip clubs.\n\nFrom Miami to Los Angeles, Prost’s latest book “Gentlemen’s Club” charts his route across the US via nearly 150 strip clubs with names like Pleasures, Temptations and Cookies N’ Cream. There isn’t a single nude woman to be seen, however, as Prost’s camera was exclusively trained on the buildings themselves — and specifically their often-colorful facades.\n\nOver the course of five weeks in 2019 he traversed over 6,000 miles, with the resulting photos capturing everything from the pastel hues of Florida’s Club Pink Pussycat to venues hiding in plain sight in the country’s more religious states.\n\n“I’d divide these venues into two types: One is very integrated into the public landscape, and one is a bit more hidden and dodgy,” Prost said, speaking to CNN on a video call and email.\n\nThe Xcape Mens Club in El Paso, Texas. Francois Prost\n\nThe first type, he added, could be found in “very American” settings, such as “around amusement parks and fast food and malls.” The latter venues, however, would sometimes look indistinguishable from any store in a strip mall. Prost said he found many such establishments along the Bible Belt, a socially conservative region in the country’s south. He was especially keen to explore the area due to the apparent contrast between the prevalence of strip clubs and what he describes in his book as “conservatism and extreme puritanism.”\n\nProst insisted that he had little interest in the interiors or services of the strip clubs, which he always visited during the day. Instead, he hoped to learn more about American culture by creating objective, documentary-style photographs of establishments sitting at the intersection of sex, gender and commerce. Documenting changing attitudes toward sex through the lens of architecture, he added that the series was primarily of a landscape photography project.\n\n“The prism of this theme of strip club facades became a way of studying and trying to understand the country,” he wrote in “Gentlemen’s Club,” photographs from which will feature in an exhibition in Tokyo in March.\n\n”(‘Gentlemen’s Club’ is) an objective panorama of dominant opinions and gender and the sexualization of the feminine image.”\n\n‘A bit strange’\n\nThe genesis of Prost’s project dates back to his 2018 series, “After Party,” which focused on the flamboyant facades of French nightclubs. He said that people frequently commented that the buildings’ exteriors looked as though they had been ripped straight out of American cities, sparking the idea that he should visit the US and extend the project.\n\nAs he meticulously planned his trip, he was struck not only by the sheer volume of strip clubs in America but that — unlike In Europe — they often demanded to be seen. Hot pink walls, gigantic nude silhouettes and even candy-cane-striped storefronts made no secret of the kind of entertainment provided inside.\n\n“A good example would be Las Vegas, where strip clubs are everywhere and their signs blink as much as a fast food (restaurant) or casino sign,” Prost said.\n\nMiami’s clubs were often painted in vivid, Wes Anderson-esque hues. Other photos show brightly covered venues contrasting with their sparse desert surroundings.\n\nLittle Darling, one of over a dozen Las Vegas establishments featured in Prost's book. Francois Prost\n\nIf the establishments were open during the day, Prost would enter and ask for permission to take photos in order “to not look suspicious… and explain what my intentions were,” he said. The interiors rarely lived up to the tantalizing promises plastered across the signs outside, but the photographer met a host of characters during his five-week trip, from indifferent bouncers to managers who were thrilled about the project.\n\n“Most of the time, people were OK — 99% of them would say yes to a facade picture,” he said, adding they typically wouldn’t mind his presence, as long as he didn’t take photos of patrons or dancers.\n\n“Some would think that it was a bit strange, some would be really excited about it and give me their business card to send me the picture when it was done,” he said.\n\nProst said his biggest surprise, however, was how “normalized” strip clubs appeared to be in everyday life. As he reflects in his book, “The relationship that Americans seem to have with strip clubs is quite different to what you see in Europe. Going to a strip club seems to be a lot more normalized … You go as a couple, or amongst friends at night to have fun.”\n\nHe was struck, for instance, by the fact that so many Las Vegas strip clubs doubled as restaurants — with many boasting happy hour deals, buffets and special discounts for truck drivers or construction workers.\n\n“I noticed a few strip clubs that would advertise being a strip club and steakhouse, so you could eat a big piece of meat (while) watching strippers. That is also something that seems very American to me,” he said, adding: “I heard from some people I met in Portland there are even strip clubs (that offer) vegan food.”\n\nObjects of desire\n\nThe facades are littered with jokes like “My sex life is like the Sahara, 2 palms, no dates” and pun-based names like Booby Trap and Bottoms Up. Prost’s documentarian approach heightens the signs’ surreal comedy. But it also doubles as a neutral lens through which viewers can make up their own minds about the objectification of women.\n\nDreams Club in Los Angeles, California. Francois Prost\n\nBy honing in on the faceless dancing bodies of female silhouettes and the quintessential “girls girls girls” signs, “Gentleman’s Club” explores the commodification of women who are, in reality, completely absent in Prost’s works (an observation reflected in the book’s title, which is a phrase that crops up numerous times on signs throughout his photographs). The strip clubs he visited market women as things to be consumed, from the many food-themed names to an advertisement reading, “1,000’s of beautiful girls & three ugly ones.”\n\nFor his next project, Prost plans to visit Japan to document the nation’s love hotels, which occupy a similar role as strip clubs in some parts of the US: open secrets in a conservative society. But the photographer believes the American establishments he visited say something unique about the country — something that is less about sexuality and more about the American dream.\n\nWhat his project has shown him is, he said, this: “As long as you’re successful in terms of business, (it doesn’t matter) if your activity deals with sex.”\n\n“Gentlemen’s Club” will be exhibited at Agnes b. Galerie Boutique in Tokyo, Japan, between March 17 and April 15, 2023. The book, published by Fisheye Editions, is available now.",

    "text": "Editor’s Note: The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer. CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation.\n\nCNN —\n\nWe all know the routine by heart: “Please ensure your seats are in the upright position, tray tables stowed, window shades are up, laptops are stored in the overhead bins and electronic devices are set to flight mode.”\n\nNow, the first four are reasonable, right? Window shades need to be up so we can see if there’s an emergency, such as fire. Tray tables need to be stowed and seats upright so we can get out of the row quickly. Laptops can become projectiles in an emergency, as the seat back pockets are not strong enough to contain them.\n\nAnd mobile phones need to be set to flight mode so they can’t cause an emergency for the airplane, right? Well, it depends whom you ask.\n\nTechnology has advanced a great deal\n\nAviation navigation and communication relies on radio services, which has been coordinated to minimize interference since the 1920s.\n\nThe digital technology currently in use is much more advanced than some of the older analog technologies we used even 60 years ago. Research has shown personal electronic devices can emit a signal within the same frequency band as the aircraft’s communications and navigation systems, creating what is known as electromagnetic interference.\n\nBut in 1992, the US Federal Aviation Authority and Boeing, in an independent study, investigated the use of electronic devices on aircraft interference and found no issues with computers or other personal electronic devices during non-critical phases of flight. (Takeoffs and landings are considered the critical phases.)\n\nThe US Federal Communications Commission also began to create reserved frequency bandwidths for different uses – such as mobile phones and aircraft navigation and communications – so they do not interfere with one another. Governments around the globe developed the same strategies and policies to prevent interference problems with aviation. In the EU, electronic devices have been allowed to stay on since 2014.\n\n2.2 billion passengers\n\nWhy then, with these global standards in place, has the aviation industry continued to ban the use of mobile phones? One of the problems lies with something you may not expect – ground interference.\n\nWireless networks are connected by a series of towers; the networks could become overloaded if passengers flying over these ground networks are all using their phones. The number of passengers that flew in 2021 was over 2.2 billion, and that’s half of what the 2019 passenger numbers were. The wireless companies might have a point here.\n\nOf course, when it comes to mobile networks, the biggest change in recent years is the move to a new standard. Current 5G wireless networks – desirable for their higher speed data transfer – have caused concern for many within the aviation industry.\n\nRadio frequency bandwidth is limited, yet we are still trying to add more new devices to it. The aviation industry points out that the 5G wireless network bandwidth spectrum is remarkably close to the reserved aviation bandwidth spectrum, which may cause interference with navigation systems near airports that assist with landing the aircraft.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Airline executives worry about your cellphone's 5G network. Here's why (2021) 02:14 • Source: CNN Airline executives worry about your cellphone's 5G network. Here's why (2021) 02:14\n\nAirport operators in Australia and the US have voiced aviation safety concerns linked to 5G rollout, however it appears to have rolled out without such problems in the European Union. Either way, it is prudent to limit mobile phone use on planes while issues around 5G are sorted out.\n\nUltimately, we can’t forget air rage\n\nMost airlines now provide customers with Wi-Fi services that are either pay-as-you-go or free. With new Wi-Fi technologies, passengers could theoretically use their mobile phones to make video calls with friends or clients in-flight.\n\nOn a recent flight, I spoke with a cabin attendant and asked her opinion on phone use during flights. It would be an inconvenience for cabin crew to wait for passengers to finish their call to ask them if they would like any drinks or something to eat, she stated. On an airliner with 200+ passengers, in-flight service would take longer to complete if everyone was making phone calls.\n\nFor me, the problem with in-flight use of phones is more about the social experience of having 200+ people on a plane, and all potentially talking at once. In a time when disruptive passenger behaviour, including “air rage”, is increasingly frequent, phone use in flight might be another trigger that changes the whole flight experience.\n\nDisruptive behaviours take on various forms, from noncompliance to safety requirements such as not wearing seat belts, verbal altercations with fellow passengers and cabin crew, to physical altercations with passengers and cabin crews – typically identified as air rage.\n\nIn conclusion – in-flight use of phones does not currently impair the aircraft’s ability to operate. But cabin crews may prefer not to be delayed in providing in-flight service to all of the passengers – it’s a lot of people to serve.\n\nHowever, 5G technology is encroaching on the radio bandwidth of aircraft navigation systems; we’ll need more research to answer the 5G question regarding interference with aircraft navigation during landings. Remember that when we are discussing the two most critical phases of flight, takeoffs are optional – but landings are mandatory.",

    "text": "CNN —\n\nPaul Templer was living his best life.\n\nHe was 28 and conducting tours in his native Zimbabwe, with a focus on photographic safaris.\n\nHe had been away for a few years, including a stint in the British army. But he had returned to Africa’s bush country “and fell back in love with it. The wildlife, the flora, the fauna, the great outdoors, the space – just everything about it. I was at home.”\n\nTempler said Zimbabwe’s guide certification program was rigorous, and there was a lot of pride among the guides who passed. He reveled in showing tourists the area’s majestic wildlife – including the water-loving, very territorial hippos.\n\n“It was idyllic,” he told CNN Travel. “Life was really, really good – until one day I had a really bad day at the office.”\n\nA good day for a river trek\n\nThe entire course of Paul Templer's life changed after he agreed at the last minute to take a group of tourists down the Zambezi River. Paul Templer\n\nMarch 9, 1996. A Saturday. Templer learned a good friend who was to lead a canoe safari down the Zambezi River had malaria. He agreed to take his pal’s place. “I loved that stretch of the river. It was an area I know like the back of my hand.”\n\nThe expedition consisted of six safari clients (four Air France crewmembers and a couple from Germany), three apprentice guides plus Templer. They had three canoes – clients in the first two seats and a guide in the back. Then one apprentice guide was in a one-person safety kayak.\n\nAnd down the famed Zambezi they went. “Things were going the way they were supposed to go. Everyone was having a pretty good time.”\n\nPossible trouble ahead\n\nZambezi National Park in Zimbabwe affords many wildlife viewing opportunites, including one of Africa's most intriguing animals: hippos. Richard I'Anson/Stone RF/Getty Images\n\nEventually, they came across a pod of about a dozen hippos. That’s not unexpected on the Zambezi, Africa’s fourth-longest river. They weren’t alarmed at first as they were at a safe distance. But “we were getting closer, and I was trying to take evasive action. … The idea was let’s just paddle safely around the hippos.”\n\nTempler’s canoe led the way, with the other two canoes and kayak to follow. He pulled into a little channel waiting on the others. But the third canoe had fallen back from the group and was off the planned course. Templer’s not sure how that happened.\n\nSuddenly, there’s this big thud. And I see the canoe, like the back of it, catapulted up into the air. Paul Templer\n\n“Suddenly, there’s this big thud. And I see the canoe, like the back of it, catapulted up into the air. And Evans, the guide in the back of the canoe, catapulted out of the canoe.” The clients managed to remain in the canoe somehow.\n\n“Evans is in the water, and the current is washing Evans toward a mama hippo and her calf 150 meters [490 feet] away. … So I know I’ve got to get him out quickly. I don’t have time to drop my clients off.” He yells to Ben, one of the other guides, to retrieve the clients who were in the canoe that had been attacked.\n\nBen got the clients to safety on a rock in the middle of the river that hippos couldn’t climb.\n\nAttempting a rescue\n\nMeanwhile, Templer turned his canoe around to get Evans. The plan was to pull alongside of him and pull him into Templer’s canoe.\n\n“I was paddling towards him … getting closer, and I saw this bow wave coming towards me. If you’ve ever seen any of those old movies with a torpedo coming toward a ship, it was kind of like that. I knew it was either a hippo or a really large crocodile coming at me,” he said.\n\n“But I also knew that if I slapped the blade of my paddle on water … that’s really loud. And the percussion underwater seems to turn the animals away,” he said. “So I slapped the water, and as it was supposed to do, the torpedo wave stops.”\n\nHe was getting closer to Evans, but they were also getting closer to the female and calf.\n\n“I’m leaning over – it’s kind of a made-for-Hollywood movie – Evans is reaching up. … Our fingers almost touched. And then the water between us just erupted. Happened so fast I didn’t see a thing.”\n\nWhat happened next was nightmarish and surreal.\n\n“My world went dark and strangely quiet.” Templer said it took a few seconds to figure out what was going on.\n\n“From the waist down, I could feel the water. I could feel I was wet in the river. From my waist up, it was different. I was warm, and it wasn’t wet like the river, but it wasn’t dry either. And it was just incredible pressure on my lower back. I tried to move around; I couldn’t.\n\n“I realized I was up to my waist down a hippo’s throat.”\n\nHippos: Huge, territorial and dangerous\n\nHippos are at home in the water or on land. This hippo was in Chobe National Park, located in the famed Okavango Delta of northern Botswana. Winfried Wisniewski/The Image Bank RF/Getty Images\n\nThere’s a good reason a fully grown hippopotamus can fit a large portion of a fully grown adult in its mouth. Hippos can grow up to 16.5 feet long (5 meters), 5.2 feet tall (1.6 meters) and weigh up to 4.5 tons (4 metric tonnes), according to National Geographic.\n\nThey sport enormous mouths and can open their strong jaws to 150 degrees.\n\nTheir teeth might be the most frightening thing of all. Their molars are used for eating plants, but their sharp canines, which might reach 20 inches (51 centimeters), are for defense and fighting. Their bite is almost three times stronger than that of a lion. One bite from a hippo can possibly cut a human body in half.\n\nThey’re found naturally in various parts sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in East and Southern Africa, living in or near rivers and other water sources. (And they are an invasive species in Colombia thanks to escapees from drug lord Pablo Escobar’s menagerie).\n\nHippos are very territorial and might aggressively attack any animal encroaching on their territory, including hyenas, lions and crocodiles.\n\nHippos and humans\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'If I say run, you run': CNN goes searching for Pablo Escobar's hippos 06:43 • Source: CNN 'If I say run, you run': CNN goes searching for Pablo Escobar's hippos 06:43\n\nThey also kill people. That we know for sure. Many internet sources say around 500 a year, but an exact figure is still uncertain because some attacks and deaths come in very remote regions and don’t get reported.\n\n“The question I get asked the most when people find out I study hippos is: ‘Is it true hippos kill more people than any animal?’ Rebecca Lewison, conservation ecologist and associate professor at San Diego State University, told CNN Travel in an email interview.\n\n“I’m not entirely sure where that started but … there is no authority or reliable data. People are surprised that hippos kill people. They look slow, and they are mostly in water. There are some nonfatal interactions, but people (or hippos) tend to fare badly from interactions.”\n\nDr. Philip Muruthi, chief scientist and vice president of species conservation and science of the African Wildlife Foundation, said the AWF doesn’t have a credible source on the number of attacks or fatalities either.\n\nWhile more stats need to be collected, one study found that the probability of being killed by a hippopotamus attack is in the range of 29% to 87% – higher than that of a grizzly bear attack at 4.8%, shark attack at 22.7% and crocodile attack at 25%.\n\n‘He spat me out’\n\nThose were rather bad odds of survival working against Templer.\n\n“I’m guessing I was wedged so far down its throat it must have been uncomfortable because he spat me out. So I burst to the surface, sucked a lungful of fresh air and I came face to face with Evans, the guide who I was trying to rescue. And I said, ‘We got to get out of here!’ ”\n\nSo once again, I’m up to my waist down the hippo’s throat. But this time, my legs are trapped but my hands are free. Paul Templer\n\nBut Evans was in serious trouble. Templer started swimming back for him “and I was just moving in for your classic lifesaver’s hold when – WHAM! – I got hit from below. So once again, I’m up to my waist down the hippo’s throat. But this time my legs are trapped but my hands are free.”\n\nHe tried to go for his gun, but he was being thrashed around so much he couldn’t grab it. The hippo – which turned out to be an older, aggressive male – spat Templer out a second time.\n\n“This time when I come to the surface I look around, there’s no sign of Evans.” Templer assumed Evans had been rescued, and he tried to escape himself.\n\n“I’m making pretty good progress and I’m swimming along there and I come up for the stroke and swimming freestyle and I look under my arm – and until my dying day I’ll remember this – there’s this hippo charging in towards me with his mouth wide open bearing in before he scores a direct hit.”\n\nThis time, Templer was sideways in the hippo’s mouth, legs dangling out one side of the mouth, shoulders and head on the other side of its mouth.\n\nTotal fury\n\nTwo hippos fight each other South Africa. Males might engage in clashes over leadership of their pods, mating privileges or over territory.

So when he’d go under water, I’d hold my breath. When we were on the surface, I would take a deep breath and I would try to hold onto tusks that were boring through me” to stop from being ripped apart.\n\nTempler said one of the clients watching the horror later described it like a “vicious dog trying to rip apart a rag doll.”\n\nHe figures the whole attack took about three and a half minutes.\n\nMeanwhile, apprentice guide Mack in the safety kayak – “showing incredible bravery, risking his life to save mine – pulls his boat in inches from my face.” Templer managed to grab a handle on the kayak, and “Mack dragged me to the relative safety of this rock.”\n\nThe expedition was still in one hell of a mess, though.\n\nWho gets attacked and why\n\nThese hippos patrol their part of manmade Kariba Lake in Zimbabwe during the evening. People need to be particularly careful in hippo territory as the sun goes down and it gets dark. Martin Mecnarowski/Adobe Stock\n\nPeople living near hippo territory are more likely victims of attacks than tourists, said Lewison.\n\n“Most of the attacks happen in the water, but because hippos raid crops on farms, there are also attacks on people trying to protect their crops. There are some tourists, but largely the attacks are happening to local residents,” Lewison said.\n\nHuman encroachment from Africa’s booming population makes matters worse, increasing the chances of deadly interactions, she said.\n\nDespite the encounters gone bad, sub-Saharan Africa depends on hippos.\n\n“Hippos are important ecosystem engineers of the ecology of freshwater areas they inhabit. This is through nutrient recycling from dung (they consume large amounts of vegetation),” Muruthi said.\n\n“Hippos attack not to eat people, but to get them the hell away from them,” Lewison said. “I don’t think hippos are particularly aggressive, but I think when under pressure, they attack.”\n\nStuck on a rock and in a hard place\n\nBack on the rock in the Zambezi, Templer asked Mack where Evans was. Mack said, “He’s gone, man, he’s just gone.”\n\nTempler knew he needed to come up with a plan to get them off the rock and to the riverbank, but “first I needed to settle myself down.”\n\nHe assessed the situation: One man missing. The first aid kit, radio and gun all gone. Six scared clients, two canoes and one paddle left. And his own body was shattered.\n\n“My left foot was especially bad; it looked as if someone had tried to beat a hole through it with a hammer.” He couldn’t move his arms. One arm from elbow down was “crushed to a pulp.”\n\nBlood was bubbling out of his mouth. They realized his lung was punctured. Mack rolled Templer over and could see a gaping hole in his back and plugged it with Saran Wrap from a plate of snacks.\n\nTempler made the call: No matter the risk, they had to get off that rock.\n\nHe was loaded into a canoe. Ben paddled. The hippo kept bumping the canoe. He went from being terrified to calm on that ride back.\n\nHe described “a profound spiritual experience in which I had this incredible sense of peace and realization this was my moment of choice. Like do I go, or do I stay? Do I close my eyes and drift off, or do I fight my way through this and stick around?”\n\nIt was so intense I thought I was going to die, and when I didn’t, I kind of wished I would. Paul Templer on the pain after the attack\n\n“I chose to stick around, and as soon as I made that choice, it was more pain than I could ever imagine I could endure. It was so intense I thought I was going to die, and when I didn’t, I kind of wished I would.”\n\nBen and Templer made it out of the river, but without finding Evans. His body was found three days later. They concluded he had drowned because he didn’t have any signs of animal attack on him.\n\n“Evans did nothing wrong. The fact that he died was purely a tragedy.”\n\nMeanwhile, some people on shore had realized something was wrong in the river. A well-trained Zimbabwe rescue team was able to safely ferry everyone else off the rock.\n\n“And that was my bad day at the office.”\n\nNext ordeal: Getting medical help\n\nTempler was out of the river but not out of the woods.\n\nIt took eight hours to drive him to the nearest hospital. In a month’s time, he had several major surgeries. He thought he would lose one leg and both arms. His surgeon didn’t think he’d live.\n\nBut not only did the surgeon save Templer’s life, he saved his legs and one arm. The other arm, however, was beyond salvation.\n\nHe realized that in the ICU when he woke up and was feeling for his left hand. It was gone. “I just remember feeling devastated. I spent my whole life being active and it was almost more than I could bare.”\n\nBut then he was flooded with relief to realize his right arm and legs had been saved. For the next month, he was “emotionally all over the map.”\n\nHe got physical and occupational therapy in Zimbabwe and then more in the United Kingdom. He got a prosthesis “and then just started trying to get back to life.”\n\nHow to stay safe in hippo country\n\nThis tourist boat observes hippos in Isimangaliso Wetland Park in South Africa. Larger vessels can offer more protection from a sudden hippo attack. Jurgen Christine Sohns/imageBROKER/Shutterstock\n\nTempler, Muruthi and Lewison all say safe outings start with education – and avoiding trouble in the first place.\n\n“Hippos have no interest in dealing with people. Stay away from them, and they will leave you alone. They are not hunting humans,” Lewison said.\n\n“Do not get close to them,” Muruthi said. “They don’t want any intrusion. … They’re not predators; it’s by accident if they’re injuring people.”\n\nWant close-up views and photos of the creatures? Instead of venturing too close, invest in good binoculars and telephoto camera lenses.\n\nFollow the rules. If you are a tourist, and it says ‘Stay in your vehicle,’ then stay in your vehicle. Philip Muruthi on avoiding hippo attacks\n\nDo not walk along well-worn hippo paths, stay close to your group and don’t approach them from behind, Muruthi said.\n\n“Follow the rules. If you are a tourist, and it says ‘Stay in your vehicle,’ then stay in your vehicle. And even when you’re in your vehicle, don’t drive it right to the animal.”\n\nMuruthi also advised that your party make some noise in areas known for hippos. “It’s good for them to know you’re around.”\n\n“Hippos usually come out of water late in the evening and at night to forage, so avoid trekking along the river at that time,” Muruthi said. Also stay on high alert during the dry season when food is scarce.\n\nWarning signals\n\nA hippo male charges a the vehicle in Africa. It's important to follow the rules and stay in your vehicle when directed to do so. In short distances, hippos can outrun people -- even sprinter Usain Bolt couldn't dash away. photocech/Adobe Stock\n\nGet to know the signs of disturbed hippos, Muruthi advised, in case you wander too closely. An agitated one will open its mouth wide and yawn as aggressive display. Also watch for a head thrown back, shaking of the head, grunting and snorting.\n\n“These are signs you should have left already!” Muruthi said.\n\nIf you’ve attracted unwanted attention, Muruthi said to always remember you cannot outrun a hippo. They may look sluggish, but they can run 30 mph (almost 43 kph). Instead, you should try to climb a tree or find an obstacle to put between you and the hippo such as a rock or anthill.\n\nMuruthi, Lewison and Templer all said never stay between a hippo and the water. If it’s charging you, run parallel to the water source. As with so many other protective female animals, never get between a mama hippo and her young, Templer said.\n\nWhat if you’re in a small watercraft?\n\n“Typically, if a hippo is going to be attacking, you’ll see it coming way before. There will be that bow wave. … If you slap the water, the percussion 99.9 times out of 100 will turn the hippo,” Templer said. “If you’re in a canoe and a hippo knocks you in the water, get away from the canoe. The hippo is going for this big shape, getting it off its territory.”\n\nIt’s also safer to view hippos on the water in a larger vessel, which the animal would have a harder time capsizing, Muruthi said.\n\nOnce an attack is underway\n\nUnlike attacks by some other wild animals, humans are almost defenseless once an attack by a large hippo begins.\n\n“Once attacked, there is nothing you can do,” Muruthi said. “Fight for dear life and watch for any chance to escape.” He said you could try to poke at the eyes or any spot that might inflict unexpected pain. But given the size just of a hippo head, even that’s a tall order.\n\nHippos typically hole punch you, so there isn’t much you can do if they get hold of you. Rebecca Lewison\n\n“Hippos typically hole punch you, so there isn’t much you can do if they get hold of you,” Lewison said.\n\nBased on his attack, Templer said try not to panic “when dragged underwater. Remember to suck in air if on the surface.”\n\nAnother hippo attack survivor in this National Geographic video also was able to conserve her breath. She also grabbed the hippo’s snout, and one expert in the video theorizes that might have startled the hippo into letting her go.\n\n‘You’re the sum of your choices’\n\nPaul Templer, who lost his left arm in the 1996 hippo attack, paddles a kayak with a specially made paddle two years later to practice for his record-setting Zambezi River descent. Howard Burditt/Reuters\n\nTwo years after that attack, Templer said that he and a team made the longest recorded descent of the Zambezi River to date. It took three months and covered 1,600 miles (2,575 kilometers).\n\nHow did Templer find the resilience to reclaim his life?\n\nAfter a particularly rough day trying to maneuver in a wheelchair, he said that his surgeon told him: “You’re the sum of your choices. You’re exactly who, what and where you choose to be in life.”\n\nTempler said he focused on what’s possible vs. what he’s lost. “If you look for what’s possible, it generally is.”\n\nTempler later moved to United States; got married to the sister of a journalist on the record-setting Zambezi trip; wrote the book “What’s Left of Me”; and is a speaker.\n\nIs a safari advisable?\n\nShould people be afraid to even go on safari – especially in hippo areas – after learning of a harrowing story like Templer’s?\n\nMuruthi said go, but go smartly. Be sure to get advice from professional tour guides – and then follow their guidance, Muruthi said. “In Kenya, for example, contact the Kenya Professional Safari Guides Association,” he said.\n\nTempler said his attack was an “anomaly,” and he doesn’t want anyone to be dissuaded by what happened on his 1996 river run.\n\n“My biggest counsel would be: Absolutely go and do it. But hook yourself up with someone who knows what they’re doing out there. But by all means, go out … and experience it.”",

    "text": "Editor’s Note: Sign up for Unlocking the World, CNN Travel’s weekly newsletter. Get the latest news in aviation, food and drink, where to stay and other travel developments.\n\nCNN —\n\nHe’d spent years backpacking around the world, and Japanese traveler Daisuke Kajiyama was finally ready to return home to pursue his long-held dream of opening up a guesthouse.\n\nIn 2011, Kajiyama arrived back in Japan with his Israeli partner Hila, who he met in Nepal, and the pair set about finding the perfect location for their future venture.\n\nHowever, there were a couple of major stumbling blocks in their way. To start with, Kajiyama had very little money to speak of after years of globetrotting around destinations like Korea, Taiwan, India, Nepal, Guatemala, Cuba and Canada.\n\nHe also happened to have his heart set on a traditional Japanese house, typically known as kominka, which are usually passed down over generations.\n\n“I wanted to have a traditional house in the countryside,” Kajiyama tells CNN Travel, explaining that he was determined to find two houses located next to each other, so that he and Hila could live in one, while the other would be a guesthouse that they’d run together. “I had a vision.”\n\nGuesthouse dream\n\nDaisuke and Hila Kajiyama transformed an abandoned farming residence in Japan into a guesthouse. Dai\n\nWhen he was unable to find anything that met his requirements, Kajiyama decided to shift his search to include the growing number of abandoned homes in the country.\n\nAs younger people ditch rural areas in pursuit of jobs in the city, Japan’s countryside is becoming filled with “ghost” houses, or “akiya.”\n\nAccording to the Japan Policy Forum, there were 61 million houses and 52 million households in Japan in 2013, and with the country’s population expected to decline from 127 million to about 88 million by 2065, this number is likely to increase.\n\nKajiyama was driving around Tamatori, a small village located in the Shizuoka prefecture, between Kyoto and Tokyo, surrounded by green tea plantations and rice fields, when he came across an elderly woman farming, and decided to approach her.\n\n“I said ‘Do you know if there are any empty houses around here?’ And she just pointed,” he recalls.\n\nHe looked over at the area that she was signaling to and spotted two neglected houses side by side – a former green tea factory and an old farmer’s home – located close to a river.\n\nBoth properties had been uninhabited for at least seven years and needed a huge amount of work. Kajiyama asked the woman to contact the owner to find out if they’d be interested in selling.\n\n“The owner said that no one could live there, as it was abandoned,” he says. “But he didn’t say ‘no.’ Everybody was always saying ‘no.’ But he didn’t. So I felt there was a small chance.”\n\nGhost house\n\nJapan's countryside is littered with ghost houses, known as \"akiya.\" Kajiyama managed to convince the owners of this house to let them take it over. Dai\n\nKajiyama returned to visit the houses around five times, before going to visit the owner himself to negotiate an agreement that would see him use the old green tree factory as a home, and convert the farmer’s house into the guesthouse he’d always envisioned.\n\nWhile he was keen to purchase both of the homes, he explains that the traditions around home ownership in Japan mean that he is unable to do so until it’s passed down to the son of the current owner.\n\n“They said ‘if you take all the responsibility yourself, you can take it.’ So we made an agreement on paper,” he says.\n\nBoth he and Hila were aware that they had a lot of work ahead of them, but the couple, who married in 2013, were thrilled to be one step closer to having their own guesthouse in an ideal spot.\n\n“It’s a very nice location,” says Kajiyama. “It’s close to the city, but it’s really countryside. Also people still live here and go to work [in the city].\n\n“The house is also in front of the river, so when you go to sleep you can hear the sound of the water.”\n\nAccording to Kajiyama, the process of clearing the house, which is around 90 years old, before beginning the renovation works was one of the hardest parts of the process, simply because there was so much stuff to sort through. However, he was able to repurpose some of the items.\n\nDuring the first year, he spent a lot of time connecting with locals, gaining knowledge about the home, and helping the local farmers with farming for the first year or so.\n\nAuthentic style\n\nHe spent around $40,000 renovating the house, completing much of the work himself. Dai\n\nAlthough he wasn’t hugely experienced with renovation work, he had spent some time farming and completing building while he was backpacking, and had also taken odd jobs fixing peoples homes.\n\nHe completed much of the work on the guesthouse himself, replacing the floors and adding in a toilet, which he says was a wedding present from his parents, at a cost of around $10,000.\n\n“I’m not really a professional,” he says.” I like to do carpentry and I enjoy creating things, but I have no experience in my background.\n\n“From my several years of backpacking, I saw so many interesting buildings, so many houses of interesting shapes and I’ve been collecting those in my brain.”\n\nKajiyama was determined to keep the house as authentic as possible by using traditional materials.\n\nHe saved money by collecting traditional wood from building companies who were in the process of breaking down traditional houses.\n\n“They need to spend the money to throw it away,” he explains. “But for me, some of the stuff is like treasure. So I would go and take the material that I wanted.\n\n“The house is a very, very old style,” he says. “So it wouldn’t look nice if I brought in more modern materials. It’s totally authentic.”\n\nHe explains that very little work had previously been done to the house, which is quite unusual for a home built so many years ago.\n\n“It’s totally authentic,” he says. “Usually, with traditional houses, some renovations are made to the walls, because the insulation is not so strong. So you lose the style.”\n\nLengthy process\n\nYui Valley welcomed its first guests in 2014. Dai\n\nHe says he received some financial support from the government, which meant he was able to bring in a carpenter and also benefited from Japan’s working holiday program, which allows travelers to work in exchange for food and board, when he needed extra help.\n\nAfter doing some research into Japanese guesthouse permits, he discovered that one of the simplest ways to acquire one would be to register the property as an agriculture guesthouse.\n\nAs the area is filled with bamboo forests, this seemed like a no-brainer, and Kajiyama decided to learn everything he could about bamboo farming so that he could combine the two businesses.\n\n“This is how I started farming,” he says.\n\nIn 2014, two years after they began working on the house, the couple were finally able to welcome their first guests.\n\n“It was a beautiful feeling,” says Kajiyama. “Of course, this was my dream. But people really appreciate that it was abandoned and I brought it back to life.”\n\nHe says that hosting guests from all over the world has helped him to stay connected to his former life as a backpacker.\n\n“I stay in one place, but people come to me and I feel like I’m traveling,” he says. “Today, it’s Australia, tomorrow it’s the UK and next week South Africa and India.\n\n“People come from different places and they invite me to join them for dinner, so sometimes I join someone’s family life.”\n\nSadly, Hila passed away from cancer in 2022. Kajiyama stresses that his beloved wife played a huge part in helping him achieve his dream of having a guesthouse and says he couldn’t have done it without her.\n\n“We were really together,” he adds. “She created this place with me. Without her it would not have been like this.”\n\nWhile the three-bedroom guesthouse, which measures around 80 square meters, has been open for around eight years, Kajiyama is still working on it, and says he has no idea when he’ll be finished.\n\n“It’s never ending,” he admits. “I’m halfway, I feel. It is beautiful already. But it started off abandoned, so it needs more details. And I’m getting better at creating, so I need time to do it.”\n\nComplete transformation\n\nThe guesthouse has three bedrooms, which are available to rent for around $120 a night. Dai\n\nHe explains that he’s unable to complete work on the home while guests are there. And while the property is closed during the winter, he spends two months as a bamboo farmer and usually spends a month traveling, which doesn’t leave him much time for renovations.\n\n“Sometimes I don’t do anything,” he admits.\n\nYui Valley, which offers activities such as bamboo weaving workshops, has helped to bring many travelers to the village of Tamatori over the years.\n\n“Most of the guests come after Tokyo, and it’s such a contrast,” he says. “They are really happy to share the nature and the tradition in our house.\n\n“Most people have dreamed of coming to Japan for a long time and they have a very short time here.\n\n“So they have such a beautiful energy. I’m happy to host in this way and join their holiday time. It’s very special [for me].”\n\nKajiyama estimates that he’s spent around $40,000 on the renovation work so far, and if the feedback from guests, and locals, is anything to go by, it seems to have been money well spent.\n\n“People appreciate what I’ve done,” he adds. “So that makes me feel special.”\n\nAs for Hiroko, the woman who pointed out the house to him over a decade ago, Kajiyama says she’s stunned at the transformation, and is amazed at how many international travelers are coming to Tamatori to stay at Yui Valley.\n\n“She cannot believe how much more beautiful it is [now],” he says. “She didn’t think it was going to be like this. So she really appreciates it. She says ‘thank you’ a lot.”\n\nYui Valley, 1170 Okabecho Tamatori, Fujieda, Shizuoka 421-1101, Japan",

    "text": "Editor’s Note: This CNN Travel series is, or was, sponsored by the country it highlights. CNN retains full editorial control over subject matter, reporting and frequency of the articles and videos within the sponsorship, in compliance with our policy.\n\nUlaanbaatar, Mongolia CNN —\n\nDue to its remoteness and short summer season, Mongolia has long been a destination overlooked by travelers.\n\nBut as the country moves to further open up to tourism by easing its entry conditions for international visitors and upgrading its infrastructure, 2023 might just be the best time yet to get there.\n\nHere are 10 reasons travelers should start planning their long-dreamed-of Mongolia visit now.\n\nA growing visa-free list\n\nWith the government of Mongolia declaring 2023 through 2025 the “Years to Visit Mongolia,” citizens from an additional 34 countries can now visit the country visa-free through the end of 2025.\n\nThe addition of several European countries, including Denmark, France, Greece, Italy, Norway, Spain, and the UK, as well as Australia and New Zealand, now brings the total number of countries and territories on the visa-exempt list to 61.\n\nThe full list is here.\n\nA new $650 million airport opens its doors\n\nMongolia's new Chinggis Khaan International Airport. Saruul Enkhbold/AP\n\nAfter years of delays, a pandemic and several controversies, the newly built Chinggis Khaan International Airport finally opened in the summer of 2021.\n\nWith the ability to handle approximately 3 million passengers a year (double that of the old airport), the addition of 500 new aircraft parking spaces and the infrastructure to support an increase in domestic as well as budget flights, the airport is a welcome addition to the country’s efforts to grow tourism.\n\nBudget flights to Hong Kong from EZNIS Airways have been relaunched since the airport’s opening, and talks to resume direct flights to the United States are reportedly underway.\n\nA modern new museum\n\nThe recently opened Chinggis Khaan Museum offers a beautiful, fresh look at Mongolia’s tumultuous history.\n\nWith more than 10,000 artifacts spanning over 2,000 years, the museum explores the history of the Mongols and the empire they created – and eventually lost.\n\nThe museum’s artifacts are presented over eight floors, with six permanent and two temporary exhibition halls. Guided tours are offered in English every Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. free of charge.\n\nMongolia’s answer to Coachella\n\nMongolia's 2023 Spirit of Gobi festival will take place in August. Majesty Mongolia\n\nWhen most people think of Mongolia, music festivals and conservation-focused art installations in the heart of one of the world’s largest deserts are the last things to come to mind.\n\nBut that’s all changing thanks to festivals like Playtime, Spirit of Gobi, INTRO Electronic Music Festival and the Kharkhorum 360 Visual Art & Music Experience.\n\nPlacing international bands, DJs, and musicians from around the world alongside Mongolia’s eclectic mix of rappers, bands and folk singers, the country just might be one of the world’s most underrated places for festival lovers.\n\nCelebrate Naadam as it turns the century\n\nThe annual Naadam event has always been a great reason to visit Mongolia, but now that the festival has just celebrated its 100 year anniversary, 2023 is as good a time as ever to attend.\n\nWhile the festival’s origins are rooted in the days of Genghis Khan, when he used horse racing, wrestling and archery competitions to keep his warriors in shape between battles, Naadam only officially became a national holiday 100 years ago.\n\nToday, the festival – held in Ulaanbaatar at the National Sports Stadium, has a few more bells and whistles than it did during the days of the Great Khan.\n\nA seat at July 11’s opening ceremony is always one of the hardest tickets to score in town.\n\nTry your hand at archery the Mongolian way\n\nMongolian archery is making a comeback. Namnaa Academy\n\nMounted archery is seeing a resurgence in Mongolia thanks to guys like Altankhuyag Nergui, one of the most accomplished archers in the sport and his archery academy, Namnaa.\n\nHere, locals learn the fundamentals of Mongolian archery before mounting a horse and taking their new found skills to another level.\n\nIn the summer months, students and academy members put on weekly shows for interested spectators. The academy also offers day-long training sessions for those wanting to try this intense sport.\n\nLearn about Mongolian calligraphy from a master\n\nSpeaking of giving life to Mongolia’s most ancient traditions, the resurrection of Mongol bichig, or the traditional Mongolian script written from top to bottom and read from left to right, has also seen a major resurgence in recent years.\n\nVisit the Erdenesiin Khuree Mongolian Calligraphy Center in Karakorum to learn from master calligraphist Tamir Samandbadraa Purev about this important cultural heritage. And, while you’re there, browse the yurts filled with Tamir’s works.\n\nDitch the horse for horsepower\n\nA Mongolian hunter sends his golden eagle to catch prey. Tuul & Bruno Morandi/The Image Bank RF/Getty Images\n\nPair the release of Husqvarna’s new Norden 901 Expedition motorbike with Nomadic Off-Road’s newly announced Eagle Hunter Tour, and you have one of the fastest adventures in Mongolia.\n\nThe tour takes six riders 1,700 kilometers from Ulaanbaatar to Bayan-Ulgii, where riders eventually meet their hosts, Mongolia’s famous eagle hunters.\n\nThe only thing faster than this adventure is the rate at which Nomadic Off-Road’s tours sell out.\n\nWinter tours offer new insights\n\nProfessional musher Joel Rauzy has been leading dogsledding tours across the frozen Lake Khuvsgul for 18 years.\n\nWith fewer crowds, lower hotel rates and the chance to see one of the largest freshwater lakes in the world completely frozen over, winter in Mongolia is something else to see and experience.\n\nRauzy’s company, Wind of Mongolia, offers tours of the lake, where each person is assigned their own sled and dogs for the journey. Following Rauzy’s lead, mushers will make a loop of the lake. Activities include ice fishing, while travelers stay in winterized yurts and spend time with nomadic families along the journey.\n\nScandinavian design hits Mongolia at Yeruu Lodge\n\nYeruu Lodge is infused with Scandinavian minimalism. Yeruu Lodge\n\nNestled in the heart of Selenge province on the Yeruu River, Yeruu Lodge is the brainchild of Norwegian founder Eirik Gulsrud Johnsen, who first visited Mongolia in 2017.\n\nWith a minimal Scandinavian-style restaurant and dining area, a handful of fully kitted out yurts for guests to stay in, two pétanque courts, kayaks, a driving range, mountain bikes and a yoga area, the lodge is a destination for nature lovers.\n\nCompletely off-grid, the lodge runs off solar panels, uses of thermal heating, and all of the property’s water comes from an on-property well and is recycled after use.\n\nAdditionally, all glass, metal and plastic used at the lodge is also recycled, and food waste is turned into compost used to grow vegetables, berries and herbs onsite.\n\nThe lodge is set to open in April 2023.",

    "text": "Editor’s Note: Monthly Ticket is a CNN Travel series that spotlights some of the most fascinating topics in the travel world. In September, we’re celebrating superlatives as we look at some of the world’s biggest, tallest and most expensive attractions and destinations.\n\nCNN —\n\nHaving lived in Beijing for almost 12 years, I’ve had plenty of time to travel widely in China.\n\nI’ve visited more than 100 cities, not to mention countless towns and villages throughout the mainland’s 31 provinces.\n\nLooking back, I’ve come to realize it was my frequent visits to different parts of the Great Wall in Beijing that were a driving force behind my desire to explore the rest of the country and, along with it, the many sections of wall that lie outside the capital’s boundaries.\n\nWork on the Great Wall began more than 2,500 years ago, its origins dating back to China’s Spring and Autumn Period of around 770 BCE to 476 BCE. Various sections were added in subsequent eras as competing dynasties and factions sought to exert their control.\n\nWork eventually stopped in the 17th century.\n\nThough not a single, unbroken structure, the wall spans over 21,000 kilometers, winding through 15 provinces, 97 prefectures and 404 counties.\n\nAnd while certain sections have been incredibly popular among tourists, many parts have slipped into obscurity, disrepair and sometimes oblivion.\n\nWhether you’re planning to visit the Great Wall for the first time or the 50th, the following destinations are sure to make your trip to China even more worthwhile. (Check out the above video for dramatic aerial footage of some of these amazing sites.)\n\nYongtai Turtle City\n\nYongtai Turtle City is in north central Gansu province. Alex Sherr\n\nThe Great Wall is not simply a brick and mortar bulwark; in certain places, towers on jagged mountain peaks, fortress towns or even wide rivers count as sections of “wall.”\n\nThe Turtle City, built in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) as part of the Great Wall’s “Yellow River Defense Line,” was completed in 1608 and was home to around 2,000 infantrymen and 500 cavalry units during peak use.\n\nToday, this fortress city is located in the Sitan Township of Jingtai County in north central Gansu province.\n\nWhile there aren’t many real turtles in the “Turtle City,” the garrison town got its nickname due to its unique shape.\n\nThe south gate acts as the head and the west and east gates as the flippers. The town’s oval wall is the body, while the north gate acts as its tail. As one of the most well-preserved and truly authentic walled cities left in China today, it’s definitely worth your time.\n\nStaying in the Jingtai County center is recommended. The ancient city is only a 30-minute cab ride from your lodgings, so you can visit whenever the light is best for photos.\n\nWhen in Jingtai, try local specialties such as the five Buddha tofu and the Jingtai cold mixed noodles – both are spicy vegetarian dishes. A walk through the sprawling night market in Jingtai County People’s Square, which boasts more than 50 snack stalls, is also recommended for adventurous foodies.\n\nGetting there: Lanzhou, the capital of Gansu province, has a major international airport and high-speed train connections from many cities in China. The drive to Yongtai Turtle City from downtown Lanzhou takes about 2.5 hours (195 kilometers). From Lanzhou Zhongchuan Airport, it’s only 1.5 hours (125 kilometers).\n\nMutianyu/Jiankou\n\nThe Mutianyu and Jiankou sections of wall are about 25 kilometers in length. Alex Sherr\n\nMutianyu and Jiankou are two parts of the same Stone Dragon – two contiguous sections of the Great Wall that together stretch for roughly 25 kilometers along Beijing’s mountaintops.\n\nHistorical records show that millions of men spent centuries constructing the Great Wall. Stand atop the wall at either Mutianyu or Jiankou, and you’ll begin to comprehend the gravity of this statement.\n\nThese two sections are arguably the two most classic examples of Ming Dynasty Great Wall surviving today, and climbing either is guaranteed to be a life-changing experience.\n\nMutianyu is the best portion of the “tourist wall.” Restored in the 1980s, it’s very commercial but also superbly beautiful. Visitors not up for the hike can take a cable car to the top.\n\nTo the west of Mutianyu, Jiankou is colloquially known as the “wild wall” – no ticket needed and not commercialized. That being said, as of 2020, hiking at Jiankou has become somewhat frowned upon by the local government because of safety concerns.\n\nMutianyu and Jiankou are less than a 90-minute drive (without traffic) from downtown Beijing, yet it’s highly recommended to enjoy a night in the countryside if time allows.\n\nJiankou can be accessed via Xizhazi village; if dates align, you might even be able to spend a few days with William Lindesay, world-renowned Great Wall historian, and his wonderful family at The Barracks, their wall-side courtyard home.\n\nFor lodgings around Mutianyu, The Brickyard is a superbly comfortable choice.\n\nIn fall and spring, shades of the wall’s gray brick contrast with nature’s vibrant colors. Peak autumn foliage and spring cherry blossoms provide stunning backdrops for photos.\n\nFor winter sports enthusiasts, there’s skiing and skating next to the Wall at locations not far from Mutianyu.\n\nGetting to Mutianyu: Restrictions on applying for temporary driving licenses in China were relaxed in September 2019, so renting a car as a foreign tourist is entirely possible. (International driving licenses are not accepted in China.)\n\nYou can also hire a car with a driver for the day or take the Mutianyu Special Tourism Bus from the Dongzhimen Wai Bus Station.\n\nGetting to Jiankou: Renting a car or booking private transport is recommended. As Xizhazi is a small village, buses are scarce so it can take up to five hours to get there by public transport, as opposed to 90 minutes by car.\n\nBataizi\n\nThis Gothic church was built in 1876. Alex Sherr\n\nBataizi village sits just inside the Motianling section of the Great Wall and is home to the ruins of a Gothic church built in 1876 under the direction of a German missionary.\n\nThe church has been damaged and repaired numerous times in its nearly 150-year history; the bell tower is the only part still standing.\n\nThe juxtaposition of its ruins against the rammed-earth Great Wall makes Bataizi a unique place to spend a morning or afternoon.\n\nAfter finishing your hike along the wall and visiting the church ruins, drop in to the village’s “new” church to say hello to Father Pan; if you speak Chinese, he can answer any questions about the village’s long connection with Catholicism.\n\nBesides Bataizi, Datong should also be on your tourist map; visiting the Yungang Grottoes (a UNESCO world heritage site) and the Hengshan Hanging Temple will make your trip even more memorable.\n\nLate summer is an ideal time to visit Bataizi, as you’ll see a wonderful contrast between the Great Wall and the lush green hills.\n\nGetting there: Bataizi village is 80 kilometers west of Datong, one of Shanxi province’s largest and most famous cities. Zuoyun County is only 22 kilometers away from Bataizi – about a 35-minute drive.\n\nDatong is easily accessible by plane or high-speed train from other cities in China; a taxi from downtown Datong to Bataizi should cost roughly 300 yuan (about $43).\n\nAlternatively, you can make your way to Zuoyun County by bus then hop in a taxi.\n\nIn Datong, luxury seekers will want to head for the five-star Yunzhong Traditional Courtyard Hotel. Zuoyun County has one hotel that can accept foreigners: Zuoyun Jinshan International Hotel. Both can be found on popular hotel booking sites.\n\nLaoniuwan (aka the Old Ox Bend Great Wall)\n\nLaoniuwan, where the Great Wall and the Yellow River meet. Alex Sherr\n\nAs the locals say, Laoniuwan is where the Great Wall and the mighty Yellow River shake hands.\n\nThe Laoniuwan Fortress was built in 1467, while the most famous tower of the Great Wall in this area, Wanghe Tower (literally meaning river-watching tower), was constructed in 1544.\n\nLaoniuwan village is located in Pianguan County, part of Xinzhou city in Shanxi province, just across the river from Inner Mongolia.\n\nLate summer or early fall is a great time to visit, as you’ll avoid the potentially dangerous mountain roads during spring rainstorms, or being uncomfortably cold in a place without great infrastructure.\n\nAlong the Great Wall, there are only a few places where it meets bodies of water; of all those, this is the most stunning.\n\nA boat ride along the river is highly recommended. You’ll be able to soak in the natural beauty of the Yellow River Gorge while marveling at the steadfast resolve of these ancient architects.\n\nGetting there: Laoniuwan is difficult to get to by public transportation. The best option is to rent or book a car to take you from Datong to Laoniuwan via Bataizi – this way, you’ll be able to see two incredible locations along the Great Wall in one trip.\n\nPianguan is the nearest city, about one hour away. Pianguan does not have a train station or an airport. The only option is to arrive by bus. Shuozhou, 140 kilometers from Laoniuwan, has an airport opening later this year.\n\nFairy Tower\n\nSimatai's Fairy Tower is a sight to behold. Alex Sherr\n\nConstruction on the Great Wall in Simatai began in 1373. It was expanded and reinforced periodically throughout the Ming Dynasty.\n\nThe Fairy Tower is one of the best-known towers of the wall at Simatai but also one of the least visited due to how difficult it is to access.\n\nInstead, aim to take in incredible views of the Fairy Tower from Wangjing Tower (just a few hundred meters away). It’s a journey that will satiate even the most adventurous hikers, yet can be done without any ropes, ladders or other essential safety gear.\n\nAs with a visit to Mutianyu/Jiankou, this section of wall is guaranteed to deliver stunning views any time of year. My only suggestion is to wait for a clear day (usually visibility is great the day after it rains or snows), as the view from Wangjing Tower is unobstructed in every direction.\n\nThe hike to the Fairy Tower will leave you in awe of the Northern Barbarians’ supposed determination to reach the capital; the mountains are nearly impassable on foot, let alone by horse, with sheer cliff faces on either side.\n\nIt makes for absolutely world-class hiking and an interesting history lesson.\n\nFive-star lodgings are available at Hobo Farm; they also have an incredible restaurant that serves delicious Western and Chinese fare. For 4.5 star lodgings with a lower price tag, try Yatou’s Homestay. Both can be found on major hotel booking sites.\n\nGetting there: Both the Fairy Tower and Wangjing Tower should be accessed via Tangjiazhai village, located in Beijing’s Miyun district.\n\nTangjiazhai village is 140 kilometers from downtown Beijing, depending on your route. Booking a private car from the city is probably the most time-effective way to get there.\n\nYou can also take a high-speed train from Beijing Station to Miyun district and switch to a bus or taxi from there.\n\nDushikou\n\nDushikou stand seven meters tall in some spots. Alex Sherr\n\nConstructed during the reign of Emperor Jiajing (1507-1567), this single-wall section stands seven meters tall in some spots – no small feat considering it was made by piling stones.\n\nIt’s located just across the road from the town of Dushikou, in Chicheng in Hebei province.\n\nThe piled-stone wall at Dushikou is unique, as many other sections of the Great Wall close to Beijing were constructed using kiln-fired bricks.\n\nDushikou is best visited in the summer, specifically July and August, when the rolling hills of the surrounding grasslands are peak green. Cool evenings make for perfect outdoor barbecue/bonfire weather.\n\nYou’ll be able to find clean and comfortable farmhouse lodgings in Dushikou town; alternatively, Chicheng, 45 minutes away, has a range of hotels to choose from.\n\nLamb skewers and roast leg of lamb are specialties in these parts, as this part of Hebei is very close to the border with Inner Mongolia. Noodle lovers should also try the local oat noodles, which are delicious.\n\nGetting there: Thanks to all the infrastructure built for the 2022 Winter Olympics, the drive to Dushikou has been shortened by almost two hours. If you prefer not to drive, hop on a bus to Chicheng from the Liuliqiao Transport Hub in Beijing and take a 45-minute taxi ride to Dushikou.\n\nNote that public transportation will take one or two hours longer than private car.",

    "text": "CNN —\n\nJust because it’s on the internet doesn’t make it true. It seems so simple, but if everyone knew that, Facebook and Google wouldn’t have to pull bogus news sites from their advertising algorithms and people wouldn’t breathlessly share stories that claim Donald Trump is a secret lizard person or Hillary Clinton is an android in a pantsuit.\n\nIt doesn’t have to be this way. Fake news is actually really easy to spot – if you know how. Consider this your New Media Literacy Guide.\n\nNOTE: As we put this together, we sought the input of two communications experts: Dr. Melissa Zimdars, an associate professor at Merrimack College in Massachusetts whose dynamic list of unreliable news sites has gone viral, and Alexios Mantzarlis, the head of the International Fact-Checking Network at the Poynter Institute.\n\nFirst, know the different types of misleading and false news 1. Fake news These are the easiest to debunk and often come from known sham sites that are designed to look like real news outlets. They may include misleading photographs and headlines that, at first read, sound like they could be real. 2. Misleading news These are the hardest to debunk, because they often contain a kernel of truth: A fact, event or quote that has been taken out of context. Look for sensational headlines that aren’t supported by the information in the article. 3. Highly partisan news A type of misleading news, this may be an interpretation of a real news event where the facts are manipulated to fit an agenda. 4. Clickbait The shocking or teasing headlines of these stories trick you into clicking for more information – which may or may not live up to what was promised. 5. Satire This one is tough, because satire doesn’t pretend to be real and serves a purpose as commentary or entertainment. But if people are not familiar with a satire site, they can share the news as if it is legitimate.\n\nSecond, hone your fact-checking skills Alexios Mantzarlis trains fact-checkers for a living. He says it’s important to have a “healthy amount of skepticism” and to think, really think, before sharing a piece of news. “If we were a little slower to share and re-tweet content purely based on the headline, we’d go a good way towards combating flasehoods,” he told CNN. Melissa Zimdars points out that even those who spend a lot of time online aren’t immune to fake content. “People think this [thinking] applies only for older people,” she told CNN. “I think even early education should be teaching about communication, media and the internet. Growing up with the internet doesn’t necessarily mean you’re internet savvy.”\n\nFor starters, here are 10 questions you should ask if something looks fake:\n\n1. Does the story come from a strange URL?\n\nZimdars says sites with strange suffixes like “.co” or “.su,” or that are hosted by third party platforms like WordPress should raise a red flag. Some fake sites, like National Report, have legitimate-sounding, if not overly general names that can easily trick people on social sites. For instance, several fake reports from abcnews.com.co have gone viral before being debunked, including a June article that claimed President Obama signed an order banning assault weapon sales.\n\n2. Does the headline match the information in the article?\n\nMantzarlis says one of the biggest reasons bogus news spreads on Facebook is because people get sucked in by a headline and don’t bother to click through.\n\nJust this week, several dubious organizations circulated a story about Pepsi CEO Indra Nooyi. “Pepsi STOCK Plummets After CEO Tells Trump Supporters to ‘Take Their Business Elsewhere’,” trumpeted one such headline.\n\nHowever, the articles themselves didn’t contain that quote nor evidence that Pepsi’s stock saw a significant drop (it didn’t). Nooyi did make recorded comments about Trump’s election, but was never quoted telling his supporters to “take their business elsewhere.”\n\n3. Is it a recent story, or an old one that has been re-purposed?\n\nSometimes legitimate news stories can be twisted and resurrected years after the fact to create a false conflation of events. Mantzarlis recalls an erroneous story that actually cited a legitimate piece of news from CNNMoney.\n\nA blog called Viral Liberty recently reported that Ford had moved production of some of their trucks from Mexico to Ohio because of Donald Trump’s election win. The story quickly caught fire online – after all, it seemed like a great win for the domestic auto industry.\n\nIt turns out, Ford did move some manufacturing from Mexico to Ohio – in 2015. It had nothing to do with the election results at all.\n\n4. Are the supporting videos or photos verifiable?\n\nPhotos and videos can also be taken out of context to support a false claim. In April, the liberal site Occupy Democrats posted a video that purportedly showed a young woman getting removed from a bathroom by police for not looking feminine enough. This was during the height of the HB2 “bathroom bill” controversy, and the article clearly linked the two. “IT BEGINS,” read the headline.\n\nHowever, there was no date on the video or evidence that it was shot in North Carolina, where the “bathroom bill” was to be passed.\n\nIn fact, according to Snopes, the same video was published to a Facebook page in 2015, meaning it predated the HB2 controversy.\n\n5. Does the article cite primary sources?\n\nIt’s not just political news that can be bogus. Now8News is one of the most infamous fake-but-looks-real site, specializing in the kind of weird news stories that often go viral.\n\nOne such article claims Coca-Cola recalled Dasani water bottles after a “clear parasite” was found in the water. There was even an accompanying gross-out picture that allegedly showed the parasite, though some basic Googling reveals it is most likely a photo of a young eel.\n\nRegardless, the article had no statement or claim from any company. Clearly this would be a big story. Dasani or any number of consumer advocacy groups would publish statements or news releases about it, right? There are none to be found – because the story is 100% fake.\n\n6. Does the story feature quotes, and are they traceable?\n\nOther 98%\n\nA favorite meme of Liberal Facebook groups features a fake quote from Donald Trump that is allegedly from a People Magazine interview in 1998:\n\n“If I were to run, I’d run as a Republican. They’re the dumbest group of voters in the country. They believe anything on Fox News. I could lie and they’d still eat it up. I bet my numbers would be terrific.”\n\nThis one is easily debunked if you take even a moment to think about it: People.com has extensive archives, and this quote is nowhere to be found in them.\n\n7. Is it the only outlet reporting the story?\n\nDuring this election season, Pope Francis was roped into three super viral, and completely false, stories. According to various (fake) websites, the Pope endorsed three US Presidential candidates: First, Bernie Sanders, as “reported” by National Report and USAToday.com.co. Then, Donald Trump, as “reported” by fake news site WTOE 5 News. Finally, another fake news site KYPO6.com reported he had endorsed Hillary Clinton!\n\nIn all of these instances, subsequent reports all circled back to the fake ones. It’s always good to trace a story back to the original source, and if you find yourself in a loop – or if they all lead back to the same dubious site – you have reason to doubt.\n\n8. Is your own bias getting in the way?\n\nJEWEL SAMAD/AFP/Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nBoth Zimdars and Mantzarlis say confirmation bias is a big reason fake news speads like it does. Some of that is built into Facebook’s algorithm – the more you like or interact with a certain interest, the more Facebook will show you related to that interest.\n\nSimilarly, if you hate Donald Trump, you are more likely to think negative stories about Donald Trump are true, even if there is no evidence.\n\n“We seek out information that already fits with our established beliefs,” says Zimdars. “If we come into contact with information we don’t agree with, it still may reaffirm us because we will attempt to find faults.”\n\nSo if you find an outrageous article that feels “too good to be true,” use caution: It just might be.\n\n9. Has it been debunked by a reputable fact-checking organization?\n\nDid you know there is actually an International Fact-Checking Network (which Mantzarlis leads)? And that it has a code of principles? The code includes the ideals of nonpartisanship and transparency, among others. Sites like FactCheck.org, Snopes and Politifact abide by this code, so if you see a debunking there, you know you’re getting the real deal. View the whole list here.\n\n10. Is the host on a list of unreliable news websites?\n\nThis is where things can get tricky. There’s obviously a big difference between “misleading” news, which is usually based in fact, and “fake” news, which is just fiction disguised as fact. Zimdars’ now-famous list covers both kinds, as well as satire and sites that capitalize on clickbait-type headlines. Snopes also maintains a list.\n\nWhile Zimdars is glad her list has gotten so much attention, she also cautions that completely writng off some of the sites as “fake” is not accurate. “I want to make sure this list doesn’t do a great disservice to the ultimate goal,” she says. “It’s interesting that some of the headlines [about my list] are just as hyperbolic as the ones I am analyzing.”",

These guys were up to 1-2 a.m. in the morning developing a technology that no one else in the world is able to do at this speed and in these complicated environments.”\n\nRead: Electric race car showcases driverless future\n\nUsing a variety of sensors – including GPS, radar and ultrasonics – allied to sophisticated computer programs, the car learns how to navigate a track at speed avoiding all obstacles.\n\n“What we are doing is at the forefront of technology right now,” says Cooke, who is also CMO of Kinetik – an investment company founded by Russian businessman Denis Sverdlov which is providing financial backing for the project.\n\n“There are two or three kinds of space races, if you will – some people are going to Mars, we’re developing robotic cars and I think it’s probably one of the most, if not the most exciting space in the world right now.”\n\nAfter the successful 30-minute test in Marrakech – this year’s host city for the United Nations climate change conference (COP22) – Cooke say the company will next try racing two cars together on track with the eventual aim of having up to 10 cars competing at every Formula E ePrix weekend.\n\nA new robot race car series is set to get underway in 2017. Roborace Ltd. The planned \"Roborace\" series is scheduled to be contested during Formula E championship weekends. Organizers have commissioned Daniel Simon -- famous for his work on movies like \"Tron: Legacy\" -- to design the race car. Daniel Simon\n\nWatch a video of it in action here For now, this prototype, called the DevBot #1, is trialing the autonomous technology. Matt Knight/CNN The battery-powered prototype can reach speeds of 215 mph (350 kph), according to Roborace. Matt Knight/CNN The \"Roborace\" series is scheduled to start in 2017 and will see 10 autonomous cars all competing on the same track. Roborace Ltd. The car successfully navigated the track at Formula E's Marrakech ePrix in November. The all-electric race series will host robot races during ePrix weekends. Matt Knight/CNN The car has been developed by a small team of engineers and computer scientists. \"With this car we have several kinds of sensors,\" Sergey Malygin, Roborace's Artificial Intelligence developer, told CNN. \"First of all there are lasers measurements -- light-based, so we have information about the 3D objects around us.\" Matt Knight/CNN \"Also we have cameras, radars, ultrasonics to get the information about other vehicles and base stations,\" Malygin continues. \"We also have precise positioning systems and optical speed sensors.\" Matt Knight/CNN \"To get this information inside (the car), process it and get a valuable understanding of what is happening around us that's something that needs a lot of computing power,\" Malygin explains. The raw data is then deciphered by algorithms which tells the car where the walls are and where other cars are on the road. Matt Knight/CNN Roborace engineer, Matas Simonavicius, says each wheel is individually powered, providing more stability and safety.\n\n\"One motor drives one wheel,\" Simonavicius told CNN. \"This way you can do torque vectoring -- you can control the power to wheels much better, how it drives and the performance it gives out. It's more advanced than the conventional stability control ABS.\" Matt Knight/CNN But are driverless cars a good idea?\n\n\"I think, yes,\" Simonavicius says. \"What's the biggest cause of accidents at the moment? It's human error.\" Matt Knight/CNN \"That's why we want to bring this car into a controlled environment where you cannot hurt any people and you can prove that it works,\" Simonavicius argues.\n\nMatt Knight/CNN \"We're trying to change people's perspective of it. So they will see it at races and see it's safe and does all these cool things.\" Roborace Ltd Robot race cars are go! Prev Next\n\n“To be here at COP22 when we are celebrating an electric future, a driverless future – it’s the perfect time for Roborace,” Cooke enthuses.\n\nVisit cnn.com/motorsport for more Formula E news and features\n\n“More than anything we want people to be excited about the technology because it’s going to change our lives, it’s going to transform our cities.”",

    "text": "Story highlights The intuitive amphibious ICON A5 looks like a sports car It does require a sports pilot license to fly it\n\nTampa, Florida CNN —\n\nWhen it comes to piloting a plane, I have zero experience.\n\nIn fact, I’ve never even considered attempting it.\n\nNevertheless, as we swoop over Florida’s Tampa Bay on a gorgeous November morning, I enthusiastically take over the controls of the ICON A5, a two-seater amphibious plane that looks like a sports car, maneuvers like a jet ski and is so intuitive, the company says that even a novice can learn to fly it in less than 30 hours.\n\nAt 23 feet long and weighing in a 1,510 pounds, it’s known as a sea light-sport aircraft.\n\nDesigned to help you focus on the freedom of flying without worrying if the plane will react unpredictably, there’s nothing else quite like it on the market.\n\nNow that I’m in control, my whole body tenses for a good five minutes. Am I really ready to pilot this shiny new machine all by myself? I’m not entirely sure.\n\nHowever, I take comfort in the fact that the A5 was built specifically for people like me, and it was designed to drive like a car.\n\nPlus, the fact that Icon’s CEO and founder, Kirk Hawkins, is next to me in the cockpit doesn’t hurt either. He can take over the controls at any time.\n\nSo far, so good.\n\nWe glide smoothly through the air at about 1,000 feet, and I’m comfortable enough to take in the sights. Lovely Fort De Soto Park doesn’t disappoint.\n\nNew waves — The Icon A5 (pictured) is part of a fresh generation of design-led light aircraft shaking up an industry with new concepts. Courtesy ICON Foldable seaplane — Launched last year, the Icon A5 is a two-seat, foldable seaplane. It's so compact it fits in most car garages and can be towed behind a vehicle for overland transport. Courtesy ICON Recreational aircraft — The Icon A5 is primarily a recreational aircraft. It can be flown by anyone with a sport pilot license. Courtesy ICON Costs less than a house — The Icon A5's base price of $197,000 base rises to $247,000 with additional features. The company says it has received over 1,800 orders. Courtesy ICON Cobalt Valkyrie-X — Currently available for pre-order, the Cobalt Valkyrie-X is a piston-engined light aircraft designed by French-born California-based entrepreneur David Loury. Courtesy Cobalt Not just a pretty design — The Valkyrie-X's main purpose is moving people over relatively long distances. It's capable of flying five people from London to most of Western Europe without refueling. Courtesy Cobalt Costs less than a much nicer house — The Cobalt Valkyrie-X starts at $699,000 -- more for extras. Cobalt is currently rolling out its first test aircraft. Courtesy Cobalt Burt Rutan's SkiGull — Inventor and aviation legend Burt Rutan has developed the SkiGull, an amphibious seaplane with retractable skis. Burt Rutan Rutan's last creation? — \"It will be the last time I design and build an airplane, since I want to enjoy this one for myself,\" says Rutan, 72. \"I will explore the world with it, visiting the places you cannot easily get to any other way.\" Burt Rutan Personal airplane revolution Prev Next\n\nSquiggles of dreamy white dunes are surrounded by water that looks like it should be in the Caribbean.\n\nThe Sunshine Skyway Bridge, with its series of long-spanning cables, is equally impressive.\n\nThe adrenaline is still racing. And as most surreal experiences go, it just keeps getting better.\n\nFor starters, there’s another ICON A5 to my left, which is thrilling in itself. We are flying in formation, and my job is to mimic its movements. You’d think this would be intimidating, but it’s not.\n\nIt’s just plain fun.\n\nThat’s music to Hawkins’ ears. He’s the brains behind this newfangled plane, an idea 10 years in the making.\n\nAs a former Air Force F-16 pilot and a Stanford Business School grad, he has focused most of his adult life on making sport flying available to the masses.\n\n“The idea for us was to create an airplane where the average human being can go out and experience the world without having the burden of becoming a professional pilot,” he says.\n\nSo it makes sense that the dashboard looks like what you see in your car. There are only a few gauges that I don’t recognize.\n\n“It’s the Apple approach to things,” he says. “You humanize it, and make it intuitive and easy and cool.”\n\nHe’s so confident people will want to fly (and buy) his planes that he just opened a flight-training facility at Peter O. Knight Airport.\n\nLocated on Davis Island, five minutes from downtown Tampa, it’s a place where both beauty and sailboats abound.\n\nThe company’s other training center is in Vacaville, California, where ICON is headquartered.\n\nWide eyes and open windows\n\nBy 9 a.m., it’s time for a brief water-landing pitstop.\n\nHawkins takes over the controls. I’ve been too busy learning to fly in formation (not something non-pilots get to try very often) and interviewing Hawkins to even think about learning to do a water landing myself. It’s something Hawkins tells me most people can master in about 30 minutes.\n\nA few negative-Gs and 360-degree turns later and it becomes a fun roller-coaster ride in the sky. Plus, it’s an open-air flight, so I occasionally flop my arms out. Just because I can.\n\nAt a few hundred feet above the water, it’s easy to spot a boater waving at us, a flock of pelicans and even stingrays.\n\n“We’re gonna pull over here and stop and get out for a second,” he says.\n\nSurely he’s kidding, right? But after landing the plane on the water, he takes off his seatbelt, and I realize he’s not.\n\nSky pioneers: A light aircraft revolution is taking off\n\nSeconds later, he pops the roof and we climb onto the wings, which could easily double as diving boards. Suddenly, this feels less like a plane outing and more like I’m on a boat sunbathing.\n\nEverything is drenched in a mesmerizing golden hue. I can imagine picnicking on the beach nearby. Or taking the plane somewhere for a remote weekend camping trip.\n\nBecause the plane has a range of about 430 miles on a full tank, it’s made for short getaways.\n\n“This entire thing is about inspiring people,” he explains. “Once you learn to fly, you will never be the same. You will look at the sky different, you will look at the planet different.”\n\nDesigned to make flying simple\n\n“The primary motor skills for operating a plane are pretty easy,” Hawkins tells me. “We have people landing by themselves with an instructor on their very first day, within 30 minutes.”\n\nThat said, they’ve painstakingly taken the time to design it for safety. The goal of the spin-resistant airframe feature is that if the pilot makes mistakes, the airplane doesn’t lose control.\n\nAs a backup, there’s a complete airplane parachute.\n\n“The spin resistance feature is a big deal as it’s the first airplane that the FAA has deemed spin-resistant,” says Chris Dupin, a flight instructor and US Air Force officer. “A significant number of general aviation fatalities are from loss of control accidents that involve an unrecovered spin on the base to final turn.”\n\nPlus, there’s the angle of attack indicator, something you don’t typically see in a light aircraft. It shows you where the wing is happy (in the green) or where it could stall (in the red).\n\nThe pilot’s job is to keep the wing within the green or yellow section of the gauge. This is part of what makes water takeoffs and landings so easy to learn.\n\nBecoming a barnstormer\n\n“Kirk Hawkins has an extremely creative and innovative idea for pilot training that is more intuitive; teaching the feel of flight first and the principals and structure later, not unlike how people learn to drive,” says Christine Negroni, veteran aviation journalist and author of “The Crash Detectives.”\n\n“The world is facing a pilot shortage, so the idea of teaching differently, so that different learning styles can be accommodated could very well expand the pool of pilot candidates.”\n\nOn that note, about 40% of the folks who’ve put down deposits for the ICON A5 are not pilots, which means this plane is drawing aviation newbies.\n\nAfter an hour and a half of flying time, Hawkins lands us on the airport runway, a maneuver that you can tackle after you’ve mastered several water landings. It’s a bit trickier since it requires more precision and knowledge about crosswinds.\n\nAt this point, if I owned this plane, I’d hook it up to a trailer, fold the wings up, drive it home, and park it in the garage.\n\nGet some air time\n\nIf you want your own ICON A5, get in line. More than 1,800 customers have put deposits down.\n\nFor those who aren’t ready to shell out $207,000 to buy one, there’s the option of stopping by ICON’s training facility in Tampa, or the facility in Vacaville, California, to fly for the day.\n\nThe Sport Flying Introduction class is 1.5 hours for $595. To snag your Sport Pilot License, you will need to spend 20-plus hours and pricing varies.",

    "text": "Story highlights Africa will launch its first private satellite into space It's been built by schoolgirls\n\nCNN —\n\nThey may be teenagers, but 17-year-old Brittany Bull and 16-year-old Sesam Mngqengqiswa have grand ambitions – to launch Africa’s first private satellite into space in 2019.\n\nThey are part of a team of high school girls from Cape Town, South Africa, who have designed and built payloads for a satellite that will orbit over the earth’s poles scanning Africa’s surface.\n\nOnce in space, the satellite will collect information on agriculture, and food security within the continent.\n\nUsing the data transmitted, “we can try to determine and predict the problems Africa will be facing in the future”, explains Bull, a student at Pelican Park High School.\n\nSouth Africa's program aims to encourage girls into STEM, particularly astronomy. Less than 10% of young women are interested in STEM subjects. Coursey Karl Schoemaker\n\n“Where our food is growing, where we can plant more trees and vegetation and also how we can monitor remote areas,” she says. “We have a lot of forest fires and floods but we don’t always get out there in time.”\n\nInformation received twice a day will go towards disaster prevention.\n\nIt’s part of a project by South Africa’s Meta Economic Development Organization (MEDO) working with Morehead State University in the US.\n\nAfrica has been slow to embark on space travel. But new projects on the continent look promising. South Africa's ambitious Square Kilometer Array project aims to build the world's biggest radio telescope that will help scientists paint a detailed picture of some of the deepest reaches of outer space.\n\n\n\nPictured here: a composite image of the MeerKAT and Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) satellites. Courtesy SKA South Africa's Karoo desert will be home to the Square Kilometer Array, a cluster of 3,000 satellite dishes working in tandem over a square kilometer area. Courtesy of SPDO/Swinburne Astronomy Productions The SKA is an international affair. Its headquartered in the UK while the telescope itself has a \"dual site\" location in Australia and South Africa.\n\n\n\nAfrica's participation in the project will be ramped up by distant stations situated in Botswana, Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia and Zambia. Courtesy SKA Scientists hope the project will shed further light on the mysteries posed by the likes of quasars, dark matter and black holes. Courtesy of SPDO/Swinburne Astronomy Productions Pictured here: the first light images from the MeerKAT. The telescope array currently comprises of 16 dishes that will eventually become a part of the Square Kilometre Array. SKA Africa MeerKAT's First Light image. Each white dot represents the intensity of radio waves recorded with 16 dishes of the MeerKAT telescope in the Karoo desert.\n\n\n\nMore than 1,300 individual objects - galaxies in the distant universe - are seen in this image. SKA Africa The Nigerian government has announced its plans to launch an astronaut into space by 2030, as part of an ambitious space program.\n\n\n\nPhoto by Ronald Martinez/Getty Images Ronald Martinez/Getty Images North America/Getty Images Nigeria has already launched five satellites into space. The first - NigeriaSat-1 - was launched on a Kosmos-3M rocket from Russia's Plesetsk spaceport in 2003. SSTL The Nigerian space agency claims to have trained 300 staff to PhD or BsC level, and has ambitious plans to expand the industry, and encourage space programs across the continent. SSTL Ghana has established a new space center as part of the country's embrace of advanced technology industries. GSSTC Egypt has one of the continent's oldest space programs, having launched several satellites aboard Russian rockets. AFP/Getty Images Africa's journey to space Prev Next\n\nAmbitious first\n\nThe girls (14 in total) are being trained by satellite engineers from Cape Peninsula University of Technology, in a bid to encourage more African women into STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics).\n\nIf the launch is successful, it will make MEDO the first private company in Africa to build a satellite and send it into orbit.\n\n“We expect to receive a good signal, which will allow us to receive reliable data,” declares an enthusiastic Mngqengqiswa, of Philippi High School. “In South Africa we have experienced some of the worst floods and droughts and it has really affected the farmers very badly.”\n\nBy 2020 80% of jobs will be related to STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics), MEDO predicts, but currently only 14% of the STEM workforce globally are women. Coursey Karl Schoemaker\n\nDrought and environmental effects from climate change have continued to plague the country in recent years. An El Niño induced drought led to a shortfall of 9.3 million tons in southern Africa’s April 2016 maize production, according to a UN report.\n\n“It has caused our economy to drop … This is a way of looking at how we can boost our economy,” says the young Mngqengqiswa.\n\nInspiring girls\n\nThe girls' satellite will have a detailed vantage point of South Africa's drought crisis which led to a shortfall of 9.3 million tons in southern Africa's April 2016 maize production. Courtesy Karl Schoemaker\n\nInitial trials involved the girls programming and launching small CricketSat satellites using high-altitude weather balloons, before eventually helping to configure the satellite payloads.\n\nSmall format satellites are low cost ways of gathering data on the planet quickly. Tests so far have involved collecting thermal imaging data which is then interpreted for early flood or drought detection.\n\n“It’s a new field for us [in Africa] but I think with it we would be able to make positive changes to our economy,” says Mngqengqiswa.\n\nUltimately, it is hoped the project will include girls from Namibia, Malawi, Kenya, and Rwanda.\n\nMngqengqiswa comes from a single parent household. Her mother is a domestic worker. By becoming a space engineer or astronaut, the teenager hopes to make her mother proud.\n\n“Discovering space and seeing the Earth’s atmosphere, it’s not something many black Africans have been able to do, or do not get the opportunity to look at,” says Mngqengqiswa.\n\nThe schoolgirl is right; in half a century of space travel, no black African has journeyed to outer space. “I want to see these things for myself,” says Mngqengqiswa, “I want to be able to experience these things.”\n\nHer team mate, Bull agrees: “I want to show to fellow girls that we don’t need to sit around or limit ourselves. Any career is possible – even aerospace.”",

    "text": "Story highlights Astronauts can temporarily gain 2 inches in height but suffer muscle loss and back pain More countermeasures involving exercise may help mitigate pain and muscle loss\n\nCNN —\n\nA six-month stay on the International Space Station can be a pain in the back for astronauts. While they may gain up to 2 inches in height temporarily, that effect is accompanied by a weakening of the muscles supporting the spine, according to a new study.\n\nIn 1994, astronaut Mark Lee had his height measured by fellow astronaut Jerry Linenger as part of a study on back pain. NASA\n\nAstronauts have been reporting back pain since the late 1980s, when space missions grew longer. Their flight medical data show that more than half of US astronauts have reported back pain, especially in their lower backs. Up to 28% indicated that it was moderate to severe pain, sometimes lasting the duration of their mission.\n\nThings don’t improve when they return to Earth’s gravity. In the first year after their mission, astronauts have a 4.3 times higher risk of a herniated disc.\n\n“It’s sort of an ongoing problem that has been a significant one with cause for concern,” said Dr. Douglas Chang, first author of the new study and associate professor of orthopedic surgery and chief of physical medicine and rehabilitation service at University of California San Diego Health. “So this study is the first to take it from just an epidemiological description and look at the possible mechanisms for what is going on with the astronauts’ backs.”\n\nLike being in a body cast\n\nMuch attention has been focused on intervertebral discs, the spongy shock absorbers that sit between our vertebrae, as the culprit for the back issues that astronauts face. But the new study runs counter to that thinking. In this research, funded by NASA, Chang’s team observed little to no changes in the discs, their height or swelling.\n\nWhat they did observe in six astronauts who spent four to seven months on the ISS was a tremendous degeneration and atrophying of the supporting musculature in the lumbar (lower) spine, Chang said. These muscles are the ones that help us stay upright, walk and move our upper extremities in an environment like Earth, while protecting discs and ligaments from strain or injury.\n\nIn microgravity, the torso lengthens, most likely due to spinal unloading, in which the spinal curvature flattens. Astronauts also aren’t using the muscle tone in their lower backs because they aren’t bending over or using their lower backs to move, like on Earth, Chang said. This is where the pain and stiffening occurs, much like if the astronauts were in a body cast for six months.\n\nMRI scans before and after the missions revealed that the astronauts experienced a 19% decrease in these muscles during their flight. “Even after six weeks of training and reconditioning here one Earth, they are only getting about 68% of their losses restored,” Chang explained.\n\nChang and his team consider this a serious issue for long-term manned missions, especially when considering a trip to Mars that could take eight or nine months just to reach the Red Planet. That trip, and the astronauts’ potential time spent in Martian gravity – 38% of the surface gravity on Earth – creates the potential for muscle atrophy and deconditioning.\n\nThe team’s future research will also look at reported neck issues, where there can be even more occurrences of muscle atrophy and a slower recovery period. They are also hoping to partner with another university on inflight ultrasounds of the spine, to look at what happens to astronauts while they are on the space station.\n\nYoga in space?\n\nBecause nobody likes back pain and muscle loss, Chang suggested countermeasures that should be added to the already two- to three-hour workout astronauts have on the space station each day. Though their exercise machines focus on a range of issues including cardiovascular and skeletal health, the team believes that space travelers also need to include a core-strenghtening program focused on the spine.\n\nIn addition to the “fetal tuck” position astronauts use in microgravity to stretch their lower back or alleviate back pain, Chang suggested yoga. But he knows that is easier said than done.\n\n“A lot of yoga depends on the effects of gravity, like downward dog, where a stretch through the hamstring, calf muscles, back of the neck and shoulders are possible because of gravity. When you remove that, you may not have the same benefit.”\n\nAny machines on the space station also have to be designed with regards to weight, size and even the reverberations they could produce on the station.\n\nScott Parazynski, who walked in space seven times, assisted with construction on the space station in 2007. NASA\n\nChang and the other researchers brainstormed with a virtual reality team about different exercise programs that would enable astronauts to invite friends, family or even Twitter followers to join them in a virtual workout, making the daily repetition of their workouts more fun and competitive.\n\nOne of Chang’s teammates has felt this pain personally. Dr. Scott Parazynski is the only astronaut to summit Mount Everest. He experienced a herniated disc after returning from the ISS to Earth. Less than a year later, when he attempted to climb Everest the first time, he had to be airlifted off. After a rehabilitation process, he eventually made the summit. Now, he speaks to current astronauts about the ways they can contribute to studies about their health in microgravity.\n\nJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nKeeping the astronauts healthy and fit is the least they can do, Chang said.\n\n“When a crew comes back, they say on one side of the space station, they see this beautiful blue planet,” he said. “Everything they hold dear to them is on this fragile little planet. And they look out the other window and just see infinity stretching off into the blackness, and they come back with a different sense of themselves and their place in the universe.\n\n“All of them are committed to furthering space knowledge and making incremental steps forward in any way they can for the next crew.”",

    "text": "Story highlights Latest craze in Moscow is war game in which players race to find nuclear codes Russian officials are playing on fears, staging a mass nuclear drill\n\nCNN —\n\n“Attention! Attention!” blares the Russian voice from a loudspeaker. “The nuclear bombs will be launched in one hour.”\n\nInside a room styled as a Soviet-era nuclear bunker, a couple of Russians race to prevent a catastrophic strike on the United States.\n\nTheir quest – the latest craze in Moscow – is to find the nuclear launch codes and deactivate a hidden red button, which has already been pressed by a mad Russian general.\n\nIt’s complete fantasy; just an interactive game hosted in a building in a former industrial area of the city, harking back to the fears of the Cold War.\n\nBut amid the current tensions with Russia, in which potential nuclear confrontation with the West has again been raised, it feels a little unsettling.\n\nA mad Russian general has pushed the nuclear button - and gamers must stop missiles launching Courtesy Lev Medvedev\n\n“I’m worried because there is very stupid information from both sides,” said Maxim Motin, a Russian who has just completed the Red Button Quest game.\n\n“I know that normal people all over the world don’t want any war,” he added.\n\nA nation preparing for conflict\n\nBut Russian officials have been preparing the nation for the possibility of conflict, stoking deep-seated concerns about a standoff with the West, Russia’s old Cold War rival.\n\nRussian television has been broadcasting a mass training exercise, involving up to 40 million people across the country. It is designed to prepare responses, the government says, for a chemical or nuclear attack.\n\nThe Russian Emergency Situations Ministry issued this picture from a nationwide civil defense drill Ministry of Emergency Situations/AP\n\nThe video shows emergency workers with protective suits and gas masks leading the civil defense rehearsal, the biggest of its kind since the collapse of the Soviet Union. It suggests the Kremlin wants Russians to take the threat of war very seriously.\n\nOf course, all-out conflict between Russia and the West remains highly unlikely.\n\nAnalysts say the principle of Mutually Assured Destruction – or MAD – still holds as a deterrent, just as it did during the Cold War.\n\nBut with tensions growing over Syria, Ukraine, and the Baltic states, analysts say a small risk of contact, misunderstanding and escalation between the nuclear superpowers has become very real.\n\n“I don’t think nuclear war is likely,” says Fyodor Lukyanov, editor of Russia in Global Affairs, a prominent foreign policy journal.\n\n“But when two nuclear superpowers are operating with their military machines in the same area, very close to each other and they don’t have proper coordination, any unintended thing can happen,” he told CNN.\n\nKremlin playing up fears\n\nIt is a risk the Kremlin seems keen to play up, with state television upping its hardline rhetoric in recent weeks.\n\nIn its flagship current affairs show, Russia’s top state news anchor, Dmitry Kiselyev – dubbed the Kremlin’s propagandist-in-chief by critics – recently issued a stark warning of global war if Russian and US forces clash in Syria.\n\n“Brutish behavior towards Russia could have nuclear dimensions,” he declared.\n\nThe Russian defense ministry has also released details of the latest intercontinental ballistic missile being added to its nuclear arsenal.\n\nThe Satan 2, as it’s known, will be the world’s most destructive weapon, guaranteeing Russia’s place as a top nuclear power.\n\nIt is an apocalyptic vision that adds a further sense of realism to the fantasy quest being acted out by gamers in Moscow.\n\n“I know that now in schools in Russia they tell the children that our main enemy is the US,” said Alisa Sokoleva, another Moscow gamer.\n\n“But it sounds ridiculous to me and I’m totally sure that war is impossible,” she adds.\n\nThe quest game players - pretending to be a special ops team - are the only ones who can avert war Courtesy Lev Medvedev\n\nBack in the fake Cold War bunker, the Russian gamers have cracked the launch codes and deactivated the missile launch. The United States, it seems, has again been saved from this virtual Russian nuclear attack.\n\nHopefully, the real world will be spared such a confrontation too.",

    "text": "Story highlights Virtual reality headsets range from inexpensive Cardboard to pricey PlayStation Here are your options if you want to dip your toe in or really swim with the VR big fish\n\nThinking about treating your family to a little virtual reality this holiday? Have no idea where to start? Don’t worry.\n\nFrom Google’s inexpensive Cardboard VR viewer to Sony’s new PlayStation VR, this guide will help you figure out what makes sense for your family’s interests, needs, and budget. Here are your options if you want to dip your toe in the water, wade knee-deep, or really swim with the VR big fish.\n\nKeep in mind, virtual reality is a quickly changing technology, so always check out the companies’ websites, professional reviews on sites like CNET, and user reviews before you take the leap.\n\nVirtual Reality Viewers: Best for Families with Young Kids\n\nVirtual reality viewers are inexpensive, handheld devices that offer three-dimensional views and the feeling of being in a different place. The viewers’ lenses work by extending the depth of static images or animation but do not allow you to interact with your environment. To use them, download any app labeled “VR” in either iTunes or Google Play, launch the app, and insert your smartphone into the viewer. Most viewers use your phone’s button or another basic input to control the action.\n\nKey features\n\n• Inexpensive\n\n• Compatible with most smartphones and iOS or Android apps labeled “VR” (except for the View-Master, which uses specially designed apps)\n\n• More like a 3D movie than true VR\n\n• Best for educational content and games\n\n• Selection of high-quality apps is currently fairly limited. Try the New York Times’ VR Virtual Reality Stories and these recommendations.\n\nProducts in this category\n\n• Google Cardboard ($14.99)\n\nLiterally made of cardboard, this handheld device that you put together yourself is a fun, novel way of experiencing virtual reality. Use with any smartphone and iOS or Android VR apps. Google offers lots of different viewers, including the steampunk-looking Google Tech C-1 Glass VR Viewer ($14.99).\n\n• SmartTheater Virtual Reality Headset ($19.99)\n\nThis is a comfortable viewer with adjustable lenses, a head strap, and an easy-to-use trigger input. Comes with a cardboard, handheld motion-controller that adds some oomph to games. Works with most smartphones and any iOS or Android VR apps.\n\n• View-Master Virtual Reality ($29.99)\n\nGeared for learning rather than gaming, the View-Master is available in a range of packages that let you explore dinosaurs, space, wildlife, and more. Each pack includes insertable picture reels (your phone provides the horsepower). Works with most smartphones and specially designed View-Master iOS or Android apps.\n\nDigital tools to turn game-obsessed kids into genuine game designers\n\nVR Headsets: Best for Big Kids and Tweens\n\nMoving up in price and features are VR headsets. They’re similar to viewers in that you download VR apps from the app store and insert your phone in them. Headsets work with the exact same apps as the viewers (except for the Samsung Gear VR and Google Daydream Viewbut give you a more immersive experience.\n\nThe advantages of headsets are that they’re more comfortable to wear for a longer time, they fit better (preventing light leaks), they have better lenses, and they often have earphone ports. That’s why some people like to use them to view videos. They don’t make the videos three-dimensional, but they provide a personal-movie-theater-type experience. They also typically have built-in game controllers on the headset itself or work with handheld controllers, giving you more options in apps than you would have with a simple viewer.\n\nKey features\n\n• Pricier than viewers\n\n• Compatible with most smartphones (except the Samsung Gear VR and Google Daydream View) and iOS or Android apps labeled “VR”\n\n• More believable, you-are-there experience, but limited ability to interact with your environment\n\n• Good for games, educational content, and movie viewing\n\n• Selection of high-quality apps is currently fairly limited. Try the New York Times’ VR Virtual Reality Stories and these recommendations.\n\n• Headsets have minimum age requirements set by the manufacturers; check the age before you buy.\n\nProducts in this category\n\n• Merge VR Goggles ($79)\n\nThis big purple headset is made of flexible foam and has audio ports and dual input buttons for easy game control. Works with most iOS and Android VR apps.\n\n• Google Daydream View ($79; shipping November 2016)\n\nMade of fabric, this lightweight plush headset is designed specifically for Google’s brand-new Daydream VR platform. The platform includes Daydream-compatible phones (such as the company’s Pixel phone), apps, and controllers. Daydream View comes with a controller and the company says there will be 50 apps at launch, including games, educational content, and streaming services.\n\n• Samsung Gear VR ($99)\n\nDesigned exclusively for Samsung phones, the Gear VR includes an input pad on the side of the headset and works with bluetooth controllers, both of which let you navigate games easily. Works with Gear VR-compatible games (including Minecraft Gear VR Edition).\n\n• VR Kix Virtual Reality Headset ($49.99)\n\nIndividually adjustable lenses, a snug fit, and a smartphone tray you can customize to your phone make the Kix a good option for quality VR on any smartphone. Works with most iOS and Android VR apps.\n\n5 ways video games can help kids with special needs\n\nConsoles: Best for 12 and Up\n\nRight now, the only VR gaming console is offered by Sony. The company’s just-in-time-for-the-holidays PlayStation VR headset works with the PlayStation 4. If you don’t have a PS4 already, you could buy the PlayStation 4 Slim or a PlayStation 4 Pro (also brand-new for the holidays) and the PSVR. The headset plus the horsepower provided by the console provides an immersive, interactive VR experience.\n\nKey features\n\n• Expensive\n\n• Limited to Sony PlayStation\n\n• Totally immersive and interactive; potential for motion sickness\n\n• Games tend to be mature but plentiful, including Batman Arkham VR, 100ft Robot Golf, Final Fantasy XV VR, Battlezone, and Resident Evil 7.\n\n• Sony’s recommended age minimum is 12.\n\nProducts in this category\n\n• PlayStation VR Launch Bundle ($499.99)\n\nIncludes everything you need to turn your PS4 into a VR machine, including a headset, a camera, two motion controllers, a game, and cables.\n\n• PlayStation 4 Slim ($299.99); PSVR sold separately\n\nA newly redesigned, slimmer version of the PS4, this one has improved graphics, a lighted controller, and runs quieter.\n\n• PlayStation 4 Pro ($399.99); PSVR sold separately\n\nBetter graphics, faster action, and optimized to work better with specific “Pro-Enhanced” games\n\nWhat parents need to know about technology addiction\n\nSuper-powerful headsets: Best for Teens\n\nYou may have heard of the ominous-sounding Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. These are the ultra-powerful VR headsets that provide a fully immersive experience; some call it “the Holodeck” in reference to the alternate reality from Star Trek. Both require high-end, powerful PCs (which cost upwards of $500).\n\nKey features\n\n• Super expensive\n\n• Require compatible games (for example, Everest VR is a Vive exclusive) and high-powered computers\n\n• Full interactivity with your environment\n\n• Games tend to be mature, including The Assembly and Deus Ex Mankind Divided.\n\n• Best for families with teens; Oculus Rift’s manufacturer age minimum is 13; Valve states the Vive is “not for children.”\n\nProducts in this category\n\nJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\n• HTC Vive ($799)\n\nOffers a “room-scale experience.” If your kids play on the Steam gaming network, they’ve certainly seen ads for the HTC Vive, as it’s made by the same company, Valve, that owns Steam. Steam is offering some Vive-only games designed to take advantage of this headsets’ unique capabilities.\n\n• Oculus Rift ($599)\n\nComes with everything to make VR a reality – except the computer: a headset, a sensor, a remote, cables, an Xbox controller, and a game.",

    "text": "Story highlights Japan's innovative wearable devices includes Archelis, a \"standing\" chair designed for surgeons. Tokyo's first Wearable Expo debuted in 2015 and was largest in the world. Japan's wearable tech market is predicted to grow from 530,000 in 2013 to 13.1 million units in 2017.\n\nCNN —\n\nWhat do Discman, Tamagotchi, and Game Boy have in common?\n\nThey’re all landmark Japanese inventions from the 80s and 90s, symbols of an era when the Asian nation was a world leader in tech innovation.\n\nBut with the rise of Silicon Valley, and American tech giants such as Google and Apple, has seen Japan produce less era-defining tech over the past two decades.\n\nThat, says Professor Masahiko Tsukamoto, of Kobe University’s Graduate School of Engineering, is about to change thanks to a new generation of young entrepreneurs, an uptick in international collaborations, and new partnerships with university scientists.\n\nJapan’s focus this time around is not on smart phones or gaming, but wearable chairs, smart glasses and dog communication devices.\n\nIn short, wacky wearable tech.\n\nWearable tech in Japan\n\nIn 2013, Japan sold 530,000 units of wearable tech devices, according to Yano Research Institute.\n\nThat figure is predicted to leapfrog to 13.1 million units in 2017.\n\nPerhaps the best indication of the boom in this industry was the introduction of Tokyo’s first Wearable Expo in 2015 – at launch, it was the largest wearable tech fair in the world with 103 exhibitors.\n\nIt has featured electronic kimonos, cat communication devices, and electronic gloves to record a pianist’s finger work.\n\nAt the next show, from January 18 to 20, 2017, the organizers expect more than 200 exhibitors and 19,000 visitors.\n\n“With better functionality, lighter components and smaller designs, wearing devices is now no longer a fantasy,” says show director Yuhi Maezono. “Wearables are gathering attention as the next big growth market.”\n\nThe dog whisperer\n\nInupathy is a dog harness slated to launch at the end of this year that will allow pet owners to communicate with their dogs.\n\nAs well as a heart monitor, the harness features noise-canceling technology which can isolate the animal’s heartbeat and track its reactions to stimulus, such as food, games, people and toys.\n\nWith this data, the harness assesses a dog’s mood and changes color to inform the owners.\n\nEquipped with six LED lights, the collar glows blue to show calm, red for excitement, and displays a rainbow theme for happiness.\n\nJoji Yamaguchi, CEO of Inupathy, was inspired by his Corgi, Akane, who was a nervous puppy. To better understand the dog’s anxiety, the biologist developed Inupathy to monitor his heart rate.\n\n“I always felt like I couldn’t understand Akane very well and I wanted to get be closer to him,” says Yamaguchi.\n\n“Buddhism and old Japanese religion says every animals, plants, and even rocks have spirit inside. It’s stressful when you can’t solve problems that are upsetting them.”\n\nYamaguchi expects wearable wellness tracking will have applications for humans, too.\n\n“Personalization, of artificial intelligence will be a game-changer,” says Yamaguchi.\n\n“For instance, if you show a certain behavior before you start feeling depressed, predicting your depression from that behavior is extremely valuable for an individual. An AI that works personally for you will eventually make this possible.”\n\nA real life-saver\n\nArchelis – a wearable chair launched in Japan this year – is also creating a buzz internationally.\n\nA collaboration between Nitto mold factory, Chiba University, Japan Polymer Technology and Hiroaki Nishimura Design, in Japan, it was initially intended for surgeons, who need to rest their legs during long operations.\n\nThe chair enables its wearer to effectively sit down and stand up at the same time.\n\nThe Archelis chair. Archelis\n\n“The Archelis concept is very simple, like the simplicity of Columbus’ egg,” says Dr Hiroshi Kawahira, the surgeon behind the concept. “Long surgeries can result in back pain, neck pain, and knee pain – especially for surgeons who are older.”\n\nMade of 3D-printed panels, Archelis does not require any electrical components or batteries.\n\nThe innovation is in the effective design: flexible carbon panels wrap around the buttocks, legs and feet to provide support and minimize pressure on joints.\n\nThe system stabilizes the ankles and knees, so the pressure from being upright is spread evenly across the shins and thighs.\n\nThough the wearer appears to be standing, in fact, they are resting their back and legs while working on their feet.\n\nGet to the point\n\nOther wearables are on the smaller side.\n\nMeasuring about 3 inches long, BIRD is essentially a modern thimble that turns your fingertip into a magic wand.\n\nBIRD can control up to 10 devices at a time. MUV Interactive\n\nUsing algorithms to decode a user’s intent, the device also features precise sensors that track direction, speed, and gestures.\n\nThe technology enables users to turn any surface into a smart screen, as well as interact with other smart devices.\n\nWalking around at home, users can project a laptop screen onto a wall, switch on a coffee machine, read on any surface, and make online purchases with the point or swipe of a finger.\n\nThe developers – Israel-based MUV Interactive and Japan-based Silicon Technology – expect BIRD to be embraced by the education and corporate sectors, thanks to its ability to create collaborative presentations.",

    "text": "Story highlights Devices in the bedroom are associated with children losing sleep time and quality, new research says Even children and teens who don't stay up late online are losing sleep\n\nCNN —\n\nThese days, teachers often face classrooms filled with yawning students who stayed up late snapping selfies or playing online games.\n\nFor children and teens, using cell phones, tablets and computers at night is associated with losing sleep time and sleep quality, new research finds. Even children who don’t use their phones or the other technologies littering their bedrooms at night are losing shut-eye and becoming prone to daylight sleepiness, the analysis published today in JAMA Pediatrics finds.\n\nThe analysis found “a consistent pattern of effect across a wide range of countries and settings,” said Dr. Ben Carter, lead author and a senior lecturer in biostatistics at King’s College London.\n\nCarter and his colleagues weeded through the medical literature to identify hundreds of applicable studies conducted between January 1, 2011, and June 15, 2015. They chose 20 research reports involving a total of 125,198 children, evenly divided by gender, with an average age of 14½ years. After extracting pertinent data, Carter and his co-authors performed their own meta-analysis.\n\nFew parents will be surprised by the results: The team found a “strong and consistent association” between bedtime media device use and inadequate sleep quantity, poor sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness.\n\nSurprisingly, though, Carter and his team discovered that children who did not use their devices in their bedrooms still had their sleep interrupted and were likely to suffer the same problems. The lights and sounds emitted by the technology, as well as the content itself, may be too stimulating.\n\nThough Carter admits that a weakness of the analysis was “how the data was collected in the primary studies: self-reported by parents and children,” many of us will probably recognize our own families’ habits reflected in the statistics.\n\nElectronic bedroom\n\nA large-scale poll conducted in the United States by the National Sleep Foundation (PDF) reported in 2013 that 72% of all children and 89% of teens have at least one device in their sleep environment. Most of this technology is used near bedtime, that same report found.\n\nAccording to Carter and his co-authors, this omnipresent technology negatively influences children’s sleep by delaying their sleep time, as they finish watching a movie or play one more game.\n\nLight emitted from these devices may also affect the circadian rhythm, the internal clock timing biological processes, including body temperature and hormone release, the researchers explain. One specific hormone, melatonin, induces tiredness and contributes to the timing of our sleep-wake cycles. Electronic lights can delay the release of melatonin, disrupting this cycle and making it harder to fall asleep.\n\nCarter and his co-authors also suggest that online content may be psychologically stimulating and keep children and teens awake far past the hour when they turn off their devices and try to sleep.\n\n“Sleep is vital for children,” said Dr. Sujay Kansagra, director of the pediatric neurology sleep medicine program at Duke University Medical Center, who was not involved in the new analysis. “We know that sleep plays a crucial role in brain development, memory, self-regulation, attention, immune function, cardiovascular health and much more.”\n\nKansagra, author of “My Child Won’t Sleep,” noted that the period of greatest brain development is in our first three years of life, which corresponds to when we need and get the most sleep. “It’s hard to believe that this would be a coincidence.”\n\nKansagra said it’s possible that parents underreported kids using devices at night, but more likely, the technology is simply interfering with sleep hygiene. “For example, children who are allowed to keep devices in their room may be more likely to avoid a good sleep routine, which we know is helpful for sleep,” he said.\n\nPracticing good sleep hygiene\n\nDr. Neil Kline, a representative of the American Sleep Association, agrees that sleep plays an integral role in a child’s healthy development, even though “we don’t know all of the science behind it. There is even some research which demonstrates an association between ADHD and some sleep disorders.”\n\nIn many respects, the findings of the new study are no surprise. “Sleep hygiene is being significantly impacted by technology, especially in the teen years,” said Kline, who bases his opinion not only on research but on his own “personal experience and also the anecdotes of many other sleep experts.”\n\nJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nSleep hygiene – tips that help facilitate good, continuous and adequate sleep – include having a room that is quiet. “And that would mean removing items that interfere with sleep, including electronics, TV and even pets if they interfere with sleep,” Kline said.\n\nOne more important tip comes from the National Sleep Foundation, which recommends at least 30 minutes of “gadget-free transition time” before bedtime. Power down for better sleep.\n\nOther recommendations for good sleep hygiene include not exercising (physically or mentally) too close to bedtime; establishing a regular sleep schedule; limiting exposure to light prior to sleep; avoiding stimulants such as alcohol, caffeine and nicotine in the hours before bedtime; and creating a dark, comfortable and peaceful sleep environment.",

    "text": "The United States has sent $7.5m to the government of Equatorial Guinea, one of the world’s most repressive and corrupt regimes, to accept noncitizen deportees from the US to the West African nation, according to a leading congressional Democrat, current and former state department officials and public government data.\n\nThe money sent to Equatorial Guinea is the first taken from a fund apportioned by Congress to address international refugee crises – and sometimes to facilitate the resettlement of refugees in the US – that has instead been repurposed under the Trump administration to hasten their deportation.\n\nAccording to government data, the sum from the Migration and Refugee Assistance (MRA) emergency fund was sent directly to the government of Equatorial Guinea, whose president, Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, has been in power for the last 46 years, and who is accused along with his son, Nguema Obiang, the vice-president, of embezzling millions of dollars from the impoverished nation to fuel their lavish lifestyles.\n\nIn a letter sent to Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, Jeanne Shaheen, the top-ranking Democratic senator on the Senate foreign relations committee, called the payment “highly unusual” and noted the country’s “history of corruption” and government officials’ “complicity in human trafficking” that raised “serious concerns over the responsible, transparent use of American taxpayer dollars”.\n\nShe also asked what protections if any would ensure that the deportees would not be “vulnerable to human trafficking, human smuggling or human rights abuses”.\n\nA copy of the letter was obtained by the Guardian. The letter was first reported by the Associated Press.\n\nThe deal fits the administration’s contentious third-country deportation push, which has alarmed human rights monitors. UN experts warned in July the policy could see people removed to foreign countries within a single day, without adequate legal safeguards or chance to raise torture or persecution concerns.\n\nWashington has approached at least 58 governments about accepting deportees, often securing agreements through cash payments or diplomatic pressure including travel ban threats. Nearly all the countries involved – including Eswatini, South Sudan and El Salvador – feature in state department reports for serious human rights abuses.\n\n“Implementing the Trump Administration’s immigration policies is a top priority for the Department of State,” said a state department spokesperson in response to an inquiry from the Guardian. “As Secretary Rubio has said, we remain unwavering in our commitment to end illegal and mass immigration and bolster America’s border security.\n\n“We have no comment on the details of our diplomatic communications with other governments,” the response added.\n\nChristopher Landau, the US deputy secretary of state, met in September with Obiang, the vice-president, who was convicted by a Parisian court in 2017 of embezzling tens of millions of euros and laundering the proceeds in France. The US Department of Justice in 2012 determined he had spent $315m around the world on properties, supercars and other luxury goods. The US ultimately seized more than $27m from the official, including properties, luxury cars and a white jewel-encrusted glove worn by Michael Jackson during his Bad tour.\n\nDuring the meeting on the sidelines of the UN general assembly, Landau and Obiang “reaffirmed joint commitments to deepen commercial and economic ties, combat illegal immigration, and advance security cooperation”, the state department said. Obiang in late October confirmed he would cooperate with the Trump administration on the “orderly reception of undocumented immigrants, under strict joint protocols designed to guarantee a safe and coordinated process”.\n\nObservers noted that the deal was conducted in relative secrecy for an administration that has been proud of its efforts to hammer out agreements for the deportation of third-country nationals (TCNs) who could not be sent back to their home countries.\n\n“Knowing that this was a direct transfer of money to a government that is highly corrupt ... was a red flag,” said a congressional aide, who called the deal a “notable, egregious agreement”.\n\nFunds for Migration and Refugee Assistance are traditionally used for “responding to refugee and humanitarian crises overseas”, said the aide, such as those in Gaza or Sudan, rather than the removal of non-citizens from the US.\n\nThere are “plenty of places where these funds should be used to support refugees overseas in the midst of conflict or humanitarian crises. There’s certainly need. So again, why are we sending this to Equatorial Guinea?”\n\nAnother congressional Democratic aide said it’s possible the state department only shared the agreement with Republican lawmakers, who have been “grossly partisan recently – even more than usual”.\n\nThe office of James Risch, a Republican senator, who chairs the foreign relations committee, did not immediately return a request for comment on how long the agreement has been on the table.",

Photograph: Toyin Adedokun/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMowaa comprises conservation labs, galleries, and studios aimed at fostering exchanges around west African art. Originally called the Edo Museum of West African Art, it is in what was once the capital of the ancient Benin empire, whose vassal states included modern-day Lagos. Benin City is now the capital of Edo state.\n\nThe museum, which is co-funded by the French and German governments as well as private donors, was supposed to host several of the Benin bronzes – the name given to artefacts looted by British soldiers during a punitive expedition in 1897 that were then scattered across collections in Europe and America. About 40 miles (65km) north of Mowaa is a smaller museum dedicated to the victim of a similar British expedition four years earlier.\n\nMore than 150 original bronzes have been returned to Nigeria over the last five years from European state museums and private collections, as the west attempts to atone for its past.\n\nHowever, a rivalry between Edo state’s former and current governors, who belong to different political parties, means none of the bronzes will be on public display at Mowaa.\n\nThe current administration is allied to Ewuare II, the spiritual and cultural leader of the Edo people. In March 2023, Nigeria’s federal government sided with Ewuare, a former diplomat who has long posited that the artefacts should be housed at the Benin palace because they were looted from there.\n\nIn its statement, Mowaa distanced itself from the state government, saying it was an independent, nonprofit institution, of which the former governor had no interest financial or otherwise. It also advised against any visits to the campus until further notice.\n\nNigeria’s culture minister, Hannatu Musawa, said: “The reported disruption at Mowaa not only endangers a treasured cultural asset but also threatens the peaceful environment necessary for cultural exchange and the preservation of our artistic patrimony.”\n\nThe incident drew mixed reactions across Nigeria, with some calling for a quick resolution as the country seeks to consolidate its standing as a cultural superpower.\n\n“This is not good optics for Edo state and not also for Nigeria,” the Lagos-based Zero Prive gallery said in a post on Instagram. “We stand in support of Mowaa as an independent body. Whatever political issues or differences let it be sorted out in the interest of the people of Edo state and the country.”",

    "text": "As many as 200 terrorists were killed in a turf war on Sunday between rival jihadists in north-east Nigeria.\n\nThe fighting between Boko Haram and rival militants from Islamic State West Africa Province (Iswap) broke out over the weekend in the village of Dogon Chiku, which lies on the shores of Lake Chad, a restive area located at the junction of Nigeria, Niger, Chad and Cameroon.\n\nThe lake’s riverine corridors serve as operational zones for jihadists who also bank on revenues from taxing fishers, loggers and herders.\n\nThe violent episode was the latest in a fight between the groups for territory and influence as more non-state actors stake a claim for dominance in the wider Sahel region. According to reports, Iswap reportedly incurred more personnel losses and several boats used in the assault were seized by Boko Haram forces.\n\n“From the toll we got, around 200 Iswap terrorists were killed in the fight,” Babakura Kolo, a member of a vigilante group that works with the Nigerian military, told Agence France-Presse.\n\n“We are aware of the fighting which is good news to us,” AFP also quoted a Nigerian intelligence source as saying. The source added that the casualty total was “more than 150”.\n\nIswap began as a splinter group from Boko Haram that allied with IS. Since the split in 2016, both factions have fought repeatedly, primarily in the Lake Chad basin area. Other groups have since split from Boko Haram, drifting to other parts of northern Nigeria.\n\nThe lake has lost more than 90% of its surface area since the 1960s, according to the UN Environment Programme. As the water recedes, new land routes across the territory open up.\n\nBy many analyst accounts, Iswap was long considered the stronger and more resourceful of the two factions, but Boko Haram was seen as successful in the fight to occupy the Lake Chad area. Sunday’s clash was potentially the deadliest between them yet.\n\nIn May 2021, Iswap launched an offensive on Sambisa, the forest enclave that was Boko Haram’s longtime base, and where it kept abducted schoolgirls. It is believed that Abubakar Shekau, the infamous leader of Boko Haram, killed himself during a clash with Iswap in Sambisa.\n\nBetween December 2022 and January 2023, Boko Haram also launched big raids on two Iswap bases in Borno state, the birthplace of the group’s radical ideology. Caches of weapons were seized as more than 100 Iswap fighters were killed and 35 others injured, according to reports by local newspapers the Guardian Nigeria and Punch.\n\nAfter the extrajudicial killing in 2009 of Shekau’s predecessor, Mohammed Yusuf, a jihadist conflict has killed more than 40,000 people and displaced around 2 million in Nigeria’s predominantly Muslim north-east.",

    "text": "Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla, a politician and daughter of the former South African president Jacob Zuma, has pleaded not guilty to incitement to commit terrorism and public violence over deadly riots in 2021.\n\nThe trial, which began on Monday in the coastal city of Durban, is the first prosecution in South Africa in which terrorism‑related charges are being brought based on social media posts.\n\nIn July 2021, Zuma handed himself in to police to serve a 15-month sentence for contempt of court over his refusal to appear before a commission investigating widespread corruption – often referred to as “state capture”. He served only two months of an 18-month prison term, mostly in the prison’s hospital wing, before he was released as part of a decision affecting certain nonviolent offenders approved by the president, Cyril Ramaphosa.\n\nHis jailing sparked riots in the provinces of Gauteng, which is home to the economic capital of Johannesburg and KwaZulu-Natal, whose capital is Durban.\n\nMore than 350 people were killed and the economy ravaged in what was considered the worst episode of domestic unrest since the end of apartheid.\n\nView image in fullscreen Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla joined the party of her father, Jacob Zuma, after he left the ANC. Photograph: Gallo Images/Getty Images\n\nProsecutors accuse Zuma-Sambudla, 43, of playing a key role in inciting the violence through social media activity.\n\nShe has denied the allegations and at a preliminary hearing wore a T-shirt with the words “Modern Day Terrorist” – a seemingly satirical retort to the charges.\n\nZuma-Sambudla followed her father when he left the ruling African National Congress in 2023 to found uMkhonto weSizwe(MK), the nationalist party named after the ANC’s former militant wing. She has become one of his most trusted allies and was elected to the national assembly in last year’s election on MK’s platform.\n\nIn court on Monday, Zuma-Sambudla smiled and seemed under no pressure. Her father, who was in power for nine years, was in court to support his daughter, who was born in Mozambique while he was in exile.\n\nProsecutors said 164 WhatsApp social media chat groups were created to coordinate the riots in 2021 and that Zuma-Sambudla “intentionally and unlawfully encouraged the public to act in acts of violence under the guise of freeing Jacob Zuma from incarceration”.\n\nA representative of the Jacob Zuma Foundation claimed the case was the latest example of the state’s targeted prosecution of the family.\n\n“For more than two decades, state institutions have been selectively mobilised to destroy President Zuma and those associated with him,” said Mzwanele Manyi. “The state’s case rests on a bizarre premise: that her social media posts during July 2021 somehow ‘incited’ unrest. In truth, her posts were reactive commentaries on events already unfolding, as millions of South Africans expressed anguish and frustration at the unlawful imprisonment of a liberation hero.”\n\nMost of the alleged corruption under investigation by the commission involved the Guptas, three brothers from a wealthy Indian business family who won lucrative government contracts and were allegedly even able to choose cabinet ministers.",

    "text": "Tanzanian authorities have detained a senior official from the main opposition party, Chadema, amid a spate of arrests in connection to deadly protests during elections last week.\n\nMore than 1,000 people were killed by security forces during the demonstrations, according to Chadema and human rights bodies. The Tanzanian government has said these figures were exaggerated but did not give its own figures.\n\nChadema said its deputy secretary general, Amani Golugwa, was arrested by police on Saturday. Authorities are seeking the arrest of nine more people, including others in the party.\n\nTanzanian authorities have charged more than 200 people with treason after last week’s protests – a charge that could carry the death penalty, though no executions have been carried out in the country since 1995.\n\nThe incumbent president, Samia Suluhu Hassan, was deemed the winner of the election, with 98% of the vote, but the opposition – which was barred from participating – condemned the results as fraudulent.\n\nThe government claimed the elections were free and fair, but the main rivals were not allowed to run, and election observers said the vote was not democratic and cited instances of ballot stuffing.\n\n“The police force, in collaboration with other defence and security agencies, is continuing a serious manhunt to find all who planned, coordinated and executed this evil act,” a police spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nChadema’s secretary general, John Mnyika, and the head of communications, Brenda Rupia, were among those wanted for arrest.\n\nThe leader of Chadema, Tundu Lissu, was charged with treason in April and not allowed to run in the elections. The exclusion of Lissu and other political figures from the ballot fuelled the ensuing protests.\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, in the run-up to the elections, Tanzanian authorities carried out enforced disappearances, arbitrary arrests and extrajudicial killings.\n\nProtests were held on 29 October in cities across Tanzania, leading to violence and clashes with police, a statement from authorities said.\n\nAmnesty International said authorities cut off internet access and used excessive force in an attempt to suppress post-election protests.\n\nRights groups said the government had cracked down on individuals perceived to be associated with the protests, including the prominent businesswoman Jenifer Jovin, who was accused of encouraging protesters to buy gas masks.\n\nPresident Samia acknowledged that there were deaths, but blamed the unrest on foreigners, stating: “It was not a surprise that those arrested were from other countries.”\n\nDespite the protests, Samia was sworn into office on Monday. Her inauguration ceremony was televised but closed to the public and held at a military parade ground in the capital.\n\nSamia became Tanzania’s first female president in 2021 after the then president, John Magufuli, died in office while she was his vice-president. She was initially praised by activists for easing political repression, but has since been accused of reversing course.",

    "text": "Canada is no longer measles-free because of ongoing outbreaks, international health experts said on Monday, as childhood vaccination rates fall and the highly contagious virus spreads across North and South America.\n\nThe loss of the country’s measles elimination status comes more than a year after the highly contagious virus started spreading.\n\nCanada has logged 5,138 measles cases this year and two deaths. Both were babies who were exposed to the measles virus in the womb and born prematurely.\n\nMeasles elimination is a symbolic designation, but it represents a hard-won battle against the infectious disease. It is earned when a country shows it stopped continuous spread of the virus within local communities, though occasional cases might still pop up from travel.\n\nMeasles typically begins with a high fever followed by a telltale rash that starts on the face and neck. Most people recover, but it’s one of the leading causes of death among young children, according to the World Health Organization. Serious complications, including blindness and swelling of the brain, are more common in young children and adults over age 30.\n\nIt is prevented by a vaccine administered routinely and safely to children around the world.\n\n“It’s a deeply disheartening development. It’s a deeply worrisome development. And, frankly, it’s an embarrassing development,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, a Brown University infectious disease expert. “No country with the amount of resources of Canada – or other countries in North America even – should lose their measles elimination status.”\n\nCanada eliminated measles in 1998, followed by the United States two years later. After hugely successful vaccination campaigns, the Americas became the first region in the world to be free of measles in 2016. Health officials estimate the measles vaccine prevented 6.2 millions deaths in the Americas between 2000 and 2023.\n\nBut vaccination rates have since slipped below the 95% coverage rate needed to stop outbreaks. Large outbreaks in Venezuela and Brazil in 2018 and 2019 cost the region its elimination status. It was reclaimed in 2024, but ends again with Canada’s loss.\n\nExperts from the Pan American Health Organization, an independent health agency, made the determination after analyzing data on Canada’s outbreaks that showed the virus has spread continuously for a year.\n\nIt has never been easy to stop measles from circulating in local communities, Dr. Jarbas Barbosa, director of the Pan American Health Organization, said in a briefing Monday.\n\n“As a region, we have eliminated measles twice,” Barbosa said. “We can do it a third time.”\n\nIn a statement, Canadian health officials said they were working with government and community partners to improve vaccination coverage, share data and provide evidence-based guidance.",

    "text": "A small turboprop plane on a hurricane relief mission to Jamaica crashed into a pond in a gated residential neighborhood of the Fort Lauderdale suburb of Coral Springs, killing two people shortly after takeoff and narrowly missing homes, authorities and a local resident said.\n\nThe Coral Springs police department confirmed the deaths in a statement Monday afternoon. But police did not provide further details about the occupants of the plane and did not immediately return messages seeking more details.\n\nMike Moser, the Coral Springs-Parkland fire department deputy chief, said emergency crews responded within minutes of a call reporting the crash. Initially, no victims were located during rescue efforts and they shifted to a recovery operation. Moser said no homes were damaged, but crews spotted some debris near the retention pond. Local aerial televised footage showed a broken fence in the back yard of one home bordering the pond where the plane went down.\n\n“There was no actual plane to be seen,” Moser said. “They followed the debris trail to the water. We had divers that entered the water and tried to search for any victims and didn’t find any.”\n\nKenneth DeTrolio told the South Florida Sun Sentinel he and his wife were in their home when the plane crashed through their back yard, destroying his fence and toppling palm trees before hitting the water. He said the impact left debris scattered across his yard and that his pool and back porch were “contaminated” with spilled fuel.\n\nThe fuel smell was so strong inside his home that it took a few hours to dissipate, he added.\n\n“We heard the strangest sound. I never heard anything like it before, and apparently that was when this plane must have flown between my home and my neighbor’s house,” DeTrolio told the newspaper.\n\nOfficials cautioned residents that police would maintain a significant presence in the area as investigators continue collecting evidence.\n\nBroward county, where the plane took off from and where the crash occurred, is home to a vibrant Caribbean American community that sprang into action to collect relief supplies after Hurricane Melissa. A powerful category 5 hurricane, Melissa slammed into Jamaica late last month, leaving a path of destruction.\n\nMoser said police would take over recovery efforts, and federal aviation officials would investigate the cause of the crash.\n\nThe small Beechcraft King Air plane took off from the Fort Lauderdale executive airport at approximately 10.14am, according to a spokesperson for the city of Fort Lauderdale, which owns and operates the airport. The crash occurred soon after takeoff, with Coral Springs police officers and firefighters responding at 10.19am, just five minutes later.\n\nAccording to Federal Aviation Administration records, the plane was manufactured in 1976. King Air models can seat between seven and 12 people, according to the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association.\n\nFederal records showed the registered owner of the plane was listed as International Air Services, a company that markets itself as specializing in providing trust agreements to non-US citizens that enable them to register their aircraft with the FAA. A person who answered the company’s phone declined to answer questions from a reporter, stating “no comment” and ending the call.\n\nThe flight tracking website FlightAware shows the plane made four other trips to or from Jamaica in the past week, traveling between George Town in the Cayman Islands and Montego Bay and Negril in Jamaica, before landing in Fort Lauderdale on Friday. It was not immediately clear who was organizing the trips.\n\nHurricane Melissa made landfall in Jamaica on 28 October, tied for the strongest landfalling Atlantic hurricane in history. The storm also caused devastation in Cuba, Haiti and the Dominican Republic and prompted relief organizations to mobilize.\n\nLocal government officials in Jamaica said in the days after the storm that Melissa had ripped the roofs off 120,000 structures, affecting about 90,000 families in the island’s especially hard-hit western region. A week after Melissa’s landfall in Jamaica, more than 2,000 people were still reported to be in shelters.",

Share Updated at 16.31 EST\n\n6h ago 15.42 EST The agenda for Cop30 was adopted on Monday, without the protracted so-called “agenda fights” over what should be discussed that have marred recent UN climate meetings. The Brazilian hosts convened negotiators on Sunday afternoon, and made clear their wishes to have a full agenda adopted before President Lula opened the summit on Monday morning, reports Guardian environment editor and Cop veteran Fiona Harvey. The formal adoption means the talks in earnest can begin without delay, which in some ways is a relief given the packed nature of this conference. However, the way in which the agenda was adopted – with some key items being combined, or moved to sit under new work streams within the negotiations – means that clarification is needed on some key issues including finance and how to stay within the 1.5C limit. Discussions on the “transition away from fossil fuels” that was agreed at Cop28 in Dubai in 2023 and regarded an obligation under international law, according to the International court of Justice landmark climate ruling in July, could be difficult to house under the formal agenda, and be moved into the “action agenda”. This is a separate grouping of issues that Brazil has instituted that, unlike items under the formal Cop agenda, can be progressed without consensus. The rush to get the agenda out should not sideline action on finance and fossil fuels, according to Mohamed Adow, director of the think tank Power Shift. It’s good to see the agenda formally adopted and the start of the Cop underway… But saving the multilateral UN process doesn’t mean we’re guaranteed to save the planet. We need to see actual steps to boost climate finance to help vulnerable countries adapt to the impacts of the climate crisis, and for countries to commit to the just energy transition by moving away from polluting fossil fuels and investing much more in clean renewables. The world has spent the last 10 years agreeing to the rules of the international climate regime. We now need to see countries acting on the regime they have signed up to – not just speaking warm words. Debbie Hillier, climate policy lead for Mercy Corps Global, a humanitarian nonprofit, said the term ‘agenda fight’ trivialized the importance for developing countries on making progress on climate finance. It is a legitimate concern of developing countries that the NCQG (New Collective Quantified Goal) did not fully reflect the legal obligations of developed countries to provide climate finance. There is currently no space for this discussion, and no way of holding developed countries to account to achieve the $300bn mobilisation goal… we are looking to the presidency to allocate a space to ensure that all relevant parties are held accountable to achieve the NCQG. My colleague Fiona Harvey predicts intense “presidency consultations” until Wednesday, at which point Brazil will have to set out how the agenda will work in practice over the remainder of the conference. Share Updated at 16.17 EST\n\n7h ago 14.55 EST Helena Smith In other but related climate news, environmentalists have slammed an energy accord that will see the US oil giant, ExxonMobil, lead a massive fossil gas exploration project in Greek waters as “profoundly out of step with the times.” Dimitris Karavellas, director of the Greek branch of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) told the Guardian:\n\nAs the world confronts the escalating climate emergency and science demands an end to fossil fuels – the Greek government has chosen to stand with the oil giants, not the planet. Agreeing to drilling in the Ionian, a biodiversity hotspot and pillar of Greece’s tourism economy, is not just disappointing – its short –sighted and profoundly out of step with the times. Under the agreement, offshore drilling for the fossil fuel is expected to begin in the Ionian sea, west of the island of Corfu – a region rich in biodiversity - by early 2027. On Sunday, Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said the deal would be key to buttressing the country’s energy security for years to come. Speaking a few days earlier in Athens, US energy secretary Chris Wright, heralded the deal as “historic” and praised Greece as a US ally that is becoming a gateway for Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) exports from America that could serve the whole region. The aim, Wright said after Athens also signed its first long-term LNG deal with the US, was to wean Europe off “its dependence on Russia” by replacing “every molecule” that Russia produced with US reserves. Wright, a former oil and gas executive with no previous government experience who has denied that climate change is a crisis, added: Greece was at the end of an energy system dominated by Russia… Today it is becoming an entry point for American gas into the European market. Share\n\n7h ago 14.27 EST Dharna Noor Cop30 marks the first-ever UN climate conference to be held in the rainforest, so it’s perhaps fitting that attendees were greeted with a torrential downpour. On Monday afternoon, buckets of rain poured over the conference center. In the media center, the roaring sound drowned out conversations and speeches being streamed from laptops, and journalists glanced up at the ceiling above them, as if worried it could cave in. (Research shows that rainstorms and drought in Brazil are becoming more severe due to the climate crisis.) The din is just one example of the slightly uncomfortable conditions inside the newly constructed conference centre. The AC is blasting, but some parts of the venue are getting quite warm – which is perhaps to be expected, given that it’s almost 30 Celsius (86 Fahrenheit) outside. However this is in contrast to last week’s pre-Cop30 leaders summit when it got so cold that some attendees had to wear sweaters, so maybe body heat from the large crowd is contributing to the stickiness. Either way, Rosângela Lula da Silva, the first lady of Brazil, apologized for the high temperatures in the conference center. The food situation at the Cop venue is also not ideal. Some vendors were sold out before 3pm, with vegetarian options especially hard to come by. Organisers did not, it would seem, heed calls from one of the world’s most famous vegetarians, Sir Paul McCartney, and animal rights group Peta (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) to serve only vegetarian food at this year’s negotiations. Share\n\n8h ago 14.06 EST States are ignoring soil’s potential as a carbon sink A new UN backed report published today (one of approximately a million we’re expecting this week) reveals that 70% of countries do not feature soil as a climate change mitigation tool in their nationally determined contributions (NDCs), their plans to reduce emissions under the Paris agreement that states must submit every five years. The new analysis conducted by Save Soil, a global grassroots movement to address the rapid degradation of agricultural soils, also found that as much as 27% of the emission cuts needed to keep global heating below a 2°C rise could be achieved and sequestered by restoring agricultural soil health. Regenerative farming practices that revitalize soil health such as cover cropping and crop rotation could also reduce fertilizer-related emissions by as much as 80% by 2050. Globally, roughly 40% of the planet’s land is degraded. The absence from NDCs is pretty shocking given that soils are the world’s largest carbon sink after oceans, according to research by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) back in 2021. Agriculture accounts for almost 30% of global emissions, and also has the potential to become a significant source of carbon capture. This, however, also remains largely absent in the NDCs submitted this year, which mostly focus on the transformation of energy and transport sectors as mitigation solutions. Countries mostly include agriculture and soil in their adaptation plans, and not as a mitigation measure to cut emissions. Praveena Sridhar, chief scientific and policy advisor of the Save Soil movement, said: The world has a 45% larger-than-expected carbon bank right under its feet, yet our current climate mitigation plans largely fail to treat soil health as the powerful, cost-effective climate solution it is. We urge policymakers to immediately prioritize soil health through regenerative agricultural practices as part of their climate mitigation and financing strategies. On mitigation specifically, the ICJ climate ruling in July 2025 lifted 1.5 Celsius from an aspirational target to a definitive legal benchmark for which states could be held legally accountable. The ICJ ruling requires countries to ensure their NDC reflects the “highest possible ambition”. The omission of soil and agriculture from mitigation plans in the NDCs makes little sense. Share Updated at 14.28 EST\n\n8h ago 13.40 EST US TV networks absent at Cop30: a “tragic abdication” of civic responsibility Jonathan Watts After a slow start, the media centre at Cop30 is a hive of activity. But there is a notable lack of TV reporters from the United States. A big part of the reason, of course, is that President Donald Trump has abandoned the Paris agreement. But why should US networks fall in step with a politician? And how can the US public be aware of the dangers of global heating - and the range of possible solutions - if the major TV broadcasters fail to report on the year’s biggest global gathering of climate-related scientists, diplomats, businesspeople and activists? For insightsthe Guardian spoke to Mark Hertsgaard, executive director of New York-based Covering Climate Now, and environment correspondent for The Nation. Here is an edited version of the conversation:\n\n\n\nIt’s a shame that not one of the US TV networks have sent cameras or reporters to Belem to cover COP30. This is arguably the most important climate summit since the 2015 conference that produced the Paris Agreement, both because the devastating impacts of overheating the planet are even more evident today and because the past decade’s extraordinary advances in green technologies offer a genuine opportunity to finally phase out oil, gas, and coal without economic penalty. Yet with laudable exceptions such as the New York Times and the Associated Press, most US news media are absent. It’s a tragic abdication of our civic responsibility to inform the public and hold power to account. View image in fullscreen Journalists working in the Cop30 media centre Photograph: Jonathan Watts/The Guardian To be clear, most climate journalists I’ve spoken with privately want to be here—it’s their newsroom managers and corporate bosses who’ve decided against it. The rationale is usually budgets—it costs money to fly journalists to Belem, house them, etc. But how newsrooms spend their limited budgets still reflects the editorial priorities of those newsrooms. And the fact is that climate change is not an editorial priority for many US newsrooms, despite the very visible evidence of the dangers of climate change—see the monster storm ravaging the Philippines today, the recent Hurricane Melissa in Jamaica, and countless others. This reflects a distressing lack of “climate literacy” among editorial decision makers at many US newsrooms; climate change is seen as just one more issue, a box to check every once in a while, rather than a defining story of our time. Hertsgaard also said deregulation in the US had eroded the TV networks’ sense of duty to produce serious public service journalism. As a result he added: In the name of the free market, corporate owners of networks are no longer expected to do anything but make as much money as possible. Over time, that led to the situation prevailing today, when the corporate owners of all the networks routinely demand their news divisions to make healthy profits. Which in turn leads to the massive staff cutbacks we’ve seen over the past 18 months at all of the Big Three network news divisions, most recently at CBS News, which gutted virtually its entire climate unit. The corporate owners’ bottom lines get bigger, but the American public is left increasingly misinformed about the world around them.

Rosângela Lula da Silva, who is widely known as Janja, was speaking at the Local Adaptation Champions award ceremony, which was held today in the pavilion area of Cop30, reports Oliver Milman, a Guardian US environment correspondent. The first lady helped give out four awards to those working on localized climate resilience, and said that she heard “hopes and pain” from women about the climate crisis while traveling around Brazil in her role as an envoy for the UN climate summit. Speaking in Portuguese, Rosângela Lula da Silva, said: It’s for these women that we have to make this the Cop of implementation, the Cop of truth. We have to get away from the white men in ties and go ahead and take the actions needed to tackle climate change.

She started dating Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who is 21 years her senior, in 2017, and they married in 2022 after he was released from prison and the corruption and money laundering convictions against him were annulled. When Lula began his third term as president in 2023, Janja, his third wife, became the country’s first lady. She previously worked at Itaipu dam, a large hydroelectric dam on the Paraná river located on the border between Brazil and Paraguay, and as a communications advisor to the Eletrobras electric utility.

Sawas was speaking at a press conference held by Climate Action Network (Can), the largest global network of environmental and other civil society groups, which was laying out its key demands for negotiators at Cop30. Among them is a call to build out safeguards for workers in polluting industries like fossil fuels and agribusiness, as well as better protection for communities impacted by those emitting sectors. The NGOs also called on word leaders to place monies into the loss and damage fund, which is meant to cover the cost of irreversible climate losses for developing countries and which will launch its call for proposals later today. The fund was established at Cop28 in Dubai after decades of obstruction by wealthy polluting nations, and so far only $750m has been pledged – a tiny fraction of what’s needed. Tasneem Essop, executive director of CAN, said: That fund is pretty much empty and we need funding at scale. At a separate press conference, Greenpeace International echoed the demand for climate justice. There, organizers also called for a plan to phase-out fossil fuels, and an end to the flashy pledges and promises that rarely lead to concrete action. Martin Kaiser of Greenpeace Germany said: No more declarations. Binding actions.

With Cop30 taking place on the edge of the Amazon rainforest, the world’s biggest tropical forest is an obvious focus for summit hosts Brazil, writes our environment editor Damian Carrington. But it’s not all about the Amazon. The second biggest rainforest, in the Congo basin in Africa, is also vital. It’s huge - bigger than India. A new assessment from 180 scientists says the Congo Basin absorbs about 600 million tonnes more of planet-heating carbon dioxide a year than it emits. In a press release the scientists said: That figure makes it the most carbon beneficial rainforest in the world But data shows that figure has been coming down in recent years largely due to badly managed deforestation. The Congo Basin also acts like Africa’s continental water-pump, they said, creating rain clouds that travel thousands of kilometres to fall as rain that will flow down the Nile all the way to the Mediterranean. And it’s a paradise for wildlife too, with 10,000 plant species and unique intact communities of chimpanzees and bonobos - humankind’s closest relatives. Prof Bonaventure Sonké, who co-led the report, said: “The Congo Basin is the Earth’s most important but least studied tropical rain forest.” So it’s good news that, led by Gabon and France, a group of nations at Cop30 have backed a plan to raise $2.5bn by 2030 to protect the Congo Basin rainforest.

We reiterate the need to curb the presence of fossil fuel lobbyists at the Climate COP, and ensure transparency, public participation, meaningful dialogue with civil society, and effective protection of environmental human rights defenders and their associations. These are all necessary conditions for more effective and just climate action. On Friday, we published exclusive research by the Kick Big Polluters Out Coalition that illustrated why this matters. More than 5,350 lobbyists representing the interests of the oil, gas and coal industries were allowed to participate in the previous four climate summits. These lobbyists, who were allowed to mingle with world leaders and climate negotiators, worked for at least 859 fossil fuel organizations including trade groups and 180 oil, gas and coal companies involved in every part of the supply chain from exploration and production to distribution and equipment. The figures do not even include fossil fuel representatives on official country delegations or those on behalf of other major polluting industries such as industrialized agriculture, aviation, and Big Tech. So why do they come? Just 90 of the fossil fuel corporations including ExxonMobile, Chevron, BP and Petrobas which sent some of the highest number of lobbyists, accounted for 57% of all the oil and gas produced last year - and almost two-thirds of all short-term upstream expansion projects which are gearing up for exploration and production. The fossil fuel companies - and other polluting industries - send representatives to the climate negotiations in order to influence climate policy. Advocates and many climate vulnerable countries want them kicked because they have been successful in helping to delay and block meaningful climate action for decades. Adilson Vieira, spokesperson for the Amazonian Work Group, said: This information clearly exposes corporate capture of the global climate process … the space that should be about science and the people has been transformed into a large carbon business hall. While forest communities fight for survival, the same companies that cause climate collapse buy credentials and political influence to continue expanding their fossil empires.” How thousands of fossil fuel lobbyists got access to UN climate talks – and then kept drilling Read more Share Updated at 11.53 EST\n\n10h ago 11.36 EST Hello, this is Nina Lakhani, climate justice reporter, taking over our blog from my colleague Damien Gayle for the rest of today. This is the first UN Cop summit since the landmark climate ruling by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in July, which clarified that all states - whether they are signed up to the Paris agreement or not - are bound under international law to to act with due diligence to prevent, mitigate and remedy harms to the climate system. The ICJ judges rejected arguments from high polluting countries who opposed the case spearheaded by Vanuatu – including the US, UK, China, the EU, Russia and Saudi Arabia – that their obligations were limited to the consensus based climate regime, that is the UN framework convention on climate change, Kyoto protocol and Paris agreement. Rather, the ICJ affirmed that every person has a human right to a “clean, healthy and sustainable” environment – a prerequisite for enjoying universal foundational rights such as life, health, food, water and housing. The court also confirmed that the onus is on the industrialised wealthy countries that have contributed most to the crisis to act first. A short while ago, 25 UN experts including the special rapporteurs on climate change, Indigenous peoples and education, and a variety of other human rights issues, released a joint statement calling for “full compliance” with the ICJ ruling, along with a ban on fossil fuel lobbyists and more transparency as crucial steps in achieving just climate action. The UN experts said: The credibility of the climate COP30 as a whole depends on achieving a meaningful outcome on mitigation and international financial and technological cooperation, with specific reference to fossil fuels and related subsidies as the main drivers of climate change and their impacts on human rights, including health, economic equality, adequate standard of living, education, and cultural rights. So while the big polluters may want Cop30 to be business as usual, the landmark ICJ climate ruling is clear that failing to take decisive action on fossil fuels would be a violation of international law. So what impact could or should the ICJ opinion have on the negotiations and domestic climate policies? This is something we’ll be keeping a very close eye on throughout Cop30. ‘Existential and urgent’: what impact will ICJ climate ruling have on Cop30?

The Intergovernmental Land Tenure Pledge, billed as the first global commitment recognising land tenure to secure additional land under Indigenous communities’ control, was announced on Friday ahead of the Cop30 climate summit that kicked off Monday. So far nine tropical forest nations - Brazil, Costa Rica, Colombia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ecuador, Fiji, Indonesia, Pakistan and Tanzania - have signed the commitment with more countries expected to follow, a pledge document showed. The document, a final version of which is expected to be released on 17 November, states land rights and protection should be strengthened in another 80 million hectares that have already been formally recognised.

He said the Cop process was making a difference, but needed to move faster: “Remember that the Paris Agreement 10 years ago was at the time when it was predicted that we would exceed four degrees of temperature and today we know that we reduced it. But we also know that we have to work hard to reduce it more.” View image in fullscreen Brazil's Cop30 president, Andre Correa do Lago, at the opening ceremony of Cop30 in Belem, Brazil. Photograph: Adriano Machado/Reuters Setting out the host’s priority for the world to accelerate implementation of commitments and policies, do Lago said he hoped “this would be an adaptation Cop, a Cop that will advance the integration of climate into the economy, job creation activities and most of all a copy that will listen and believe in science.” Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Brazil’s president, stressed the importance of emissions reductions during this Cop, even though it is not on the formal agenda. “We need a road map so that humanity...can overcome its dependence on fossil fuels,” he said. He stressed the importance of reducing deforestation and putting people at the heart of climate action, particularly indigenous communities. Lula launched a fierce attack on those who spread fear and attacked science – an apparently veiled reference to Donald Trump, the US president, who has constantly called climate action a “hoax” and bullied smaller nations into weakening action on maritime emissions. In a defence of the Paris Agreement, he said the world would be doomed to catastrophic warming of 5C by the end of this century if it were not for multilateral negotiations. “We are moving in the right direction,” he said, but emphasised the need for more urgency in implementation of policies.

Mukhtar Babayev, Azerbaijan’s minister for ecology and the president of the previous Cop in Baku, passed the baton to Brazil at the opening session of COP30. He stressed the importance of building on the climate finance commitments made last year, when wealthy nations agreed to provide $300bn annually by 2035, with a broader aspiration to scale this up to 1.3trillion a year with support from private sources. “Delivering the Baku finance goal will be essential to success,” he said. “We ask vulnerable Communities to accept the limits of how much support they could expect. Now in eagle measure we see the donors deliver in full with developed countries taking the lead.” Share\n\n11h ago 10.32 EST Dharna Noor While the Trump administration is steering clear of Belém this month, Dharna Noor, Guardian US fossil fuels and climate reporter, last week wrote that dozens of US subnational leaders are planning to attend to promote their climate efforts. “Whatever our nationalised policy is or isn’t, the people on the ground locally are getting it done, committing to partnerships and economic development that will last generations and create the kind of clean energy future we are all relying on,” said New Mexico’s governor, Michelle Lujan Grisham, on a press call.

There is no official American pavilion alongside those of other major powers, no government officials, not even embassy help for the few US members of Congress who have attempted to get here amid a shutdown in Washington.\n\n\n\nGiven the hostility of the Trump administration to any sort of climate action, though, many diplomats are privately relieved that the US is staying away. They have feared a repeat of the bully-like tactics that the US recently used to stymie planned rules to curb planet-heating emissions from the shipping sector.\n\n\n\nThe Trump administration could show up and cause some fireworks next year, though, according to Chris Wright, the US energy secretary. Speaking at a business summit in Greece on Friday, some 5,000 miles away from Brazil, Wright said he may attend next year’s Cop “just to try to deliver some common sense.”\n\n\n\n“It’s essentially a hoax. It’s not an honest organisation looking to better human lives,” Wright told the Associated Press of the Cop gatherings.

Photograph: Courtesy of Mana Omar Mana Omar, 29, is the Executive Director and Founder of Spring of the Arid & Semi-Arid Lands (Sasal) and a dedicated advocate for climate justice and gender equality among Kenya’s indigenous pastoralist communities, writes Aseel Mousa, Guardian reporter. She will be attending COP as an individual representing her organisation, continuing her active engagement in climate negotiations since COP27 in Egypt. Her motivation to participate in this year’s COP — hosted in Brazil — stems from its focus on indigenous issues. As an indigenous woman from Kenya, I am passionate about amplifying African indigenous voices, which I feel are often overlooked compared to those from Latin America. Through my public speaking, advocacy, and media engagement, I work to ensure that African indigenous perspectives are recognized and included in global climate discussions. Mana’s primary area of focus is climate finance, particularly the Loss and Damage Fund. Adaptation alone is insufficient for communities already suffering from severe climate impacts. In Kenya’s arid and semi-arid regions—covering around 83% of the country—prolonged droughts, failed rains, and rising temperatures have devastated agriculture and livestock, leading to cascading social challenges such as income loss, reduced access to education, gender-based violence, and mental health issues.” Despite my commitment, I often feel frustrated with COP’s outcomes. I see a systemic exclusion of those most affected by climate change from key decision-making spaces, and even the Loss and Damage Fund’s board largely represents high-emission countries. Although I remain skeptical about seeing immediate progress, I still believe in the long-term power of persistent advocacy and collaboration among those who share the same vision for justice and inclusion.

    "text": "Guyana has been thrown into political turmoil following the arrest and possible extradition to the United States of the country’s main opposition leader just two months after he emerged as the surprise contender in the presidential election that kept incumbent Irfaan Ali in power.\n\nAzruddin Mohamed, 38, and his father, Nazar Mohamed, 73, two of Guyana’s wealthiest figures thanks to their gold mining empire, were arrested on 31 October in the capital, Georgetown, in response to a formal extradition request from the US government.\n\nFacing 11 charges in a Florida court – including money laundering, bribery and tax evasion – they were released later the same day after posting bail of 150,000 Guyanese dollars each (about £547 or $719.95), but must report to the court weekly and will face a new hearing on Monday.\n\nMohamed has claimed they are victims of political persecution by Ali’s government: “The government is fully behind the sanctions and has agents working in the US that they are in talks with,” he told local media.\n\nMohabir Anil Nandlall, Guyana’s attorney general, said the case was a “legal obligation” arising from the country’s international commitments – a 1931 extradition treaty between the UK and the US remains in force in Guyana, which became independent from Britain in 1966.\n\nThe case has become particularly emblematic at a time when relations between the Caribbean nation and the US have taken on new energy significance, with American companies leading the oil exploration that could soon make Guyana the world’s largest producer per capita.\n\n“It’s a situation where the status quo in Guyana is being challenged,” said Peter Wickham, a political scientist and director of a polling company in the Caribbean.\n\nMohamed founded a party and announced his candidacy just three months before the presidential election, breaking with the country’s long-standing two-party system that has traditionally pitted the president’s PPP/C, broadly backed by the Indo-Guyanese population, against the APNU, generally supported by Afro-Guyanese voters.\n\nMohamed urged Guyanese to reject “tribal voting” and, running on a populist, anti-establishment platform, promised to push for renegotiation of the oil deal – despite the country’s newly discovered oil wealth, more than half of its population still lives in poverty.\n\n“He hoped to become a kind of balance of power for whoever won the election, but the result ended up being better than he expected,” Wickham said.\n\nThe incumbent Ali won, and his party secured 36 of the 65 seats in congress. But unlike in previous elections, it was not the APNU that emerged as the main opposition force – it won only 12 seats – but Mohamed’s party, with 16.\n\nLast Monday, three days after Mohamed was arrested and released on bail, he was sworn in alongside the rest of the new congress. He arrived in the Lamborghini at the centre of an alleged mail fraud case against him, in which he is accused of submitting a false $75,300 invoice for a vehicle said to have cost $680,000.\n\nAlthough the US extradition request was issued last October, the investigation into Mohamed and his father began earlier, and the indictment is said to cover offences committed between 2017 and 2024.\n\nIn June 2024, a shipment containing about $5.3m in gold bars sent from Guyana by Mohamed’s Enterprise was seized at Miami international airport. That same month, the Mohameds were sanctioned by the US Department of Treasury on charges of gold smuggling, evading more than $50m in taxes owed to the Guyanese government and bribing local public officials.\n\nAt a press conference last week, vice-president Bharrat Jagdeo – who led the country between 1999 and 2011 – said the extradition request came from Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state.\n\n“You see his signature there? ‘Marco Rubio,’” he said. “It’s not a junior man in Florida … that’s the seriousness [of it] … We are part of a treaty. We are part of an international community that believes people must pay for their crimes,” said Jagdeo.\n\nMohamed and his lawyers declined to comment to the Guardian, but have previously denied wrongdoing.\n\nIn addition to describing the case as political persecution, his legal team has told local media that some of the offences listed in the US indictment are not crimes in Guyana and therefore Mohamed should not be subject to extradition. The lawyers said they intend to challenge the case at every level, including the constitutional court and, ultimately, the Caribbean court of justice.\n\nWickham said the case is likely to drag on. “While it goes on, he [Mohamed] remains a member of parliament … and I think he will continue to make life as difficult as he can for the government in his role as opposition leader,” he said.",

    "text": "Canada’s prime minister Mark Carney’s minority government has survived two confidence votes on its budget, quashing fears – for now – of a winter federal election.\n\nThe Liberals managed to pass the second of three votes on the plan on Friday, paving the way for tens of billions in new spending.\n\nThe party, which needs the support of opposition lawmakers, benefitted from Conservatives voting alongside the Liberals, putting the budget on course for a final and consequential vote in mid-November. But the results are also a reminder for Carney, the wonkish economist, of the unpredictable and fortuitous realities of politics.\n\nFrançois-Philippe Champagne, the finance minister, unveiled the Liberal government’s sprawling federal budget on Tuesday, explicitly acknowledging that a protracted trade war with the United States and a weakening domestic economy had forced the government to run a deficit tens of billions larger than initially forecast.\n\n“The level of uncertainty is higher than what we have seen and felt for generations,” he told lawmakers during his budget speech. “Bold and swift action is needed.”\n\nThat action takes the form of billions in “generational investments” that would fundamentally reshape the nature of the country’s economy.\n\nIn last December’s fiscal update, the federal deficit was projected to be C$42.2bn in 2025-26. But the Liberal plan will run a deficit of C$78.3bn in 2025-26. The government says it will aim to reduce the federal deficit to C$56.6bn by 2029-30.\n\nLeading up to the budget, Carney seemed uninterested in catering his budget to opposition parties that simultaneously argued it spent too much and too little.\n\nHe has cultivated an image of a no-nonsense technocrat eager to focus on the economy without the distractions of politics.\n\nAfter Pierre Poilievre, the Conservative leader, lost his seat in the federal election, Carney oped to swiftly call a by-election, rather than forcing the top Tory to suffer in the political wilderness.\n\n“No games,” he said.\n\nBut earlier this week Carney only controlled 169 seats – three short of the threshold required to pass a budget without help from opposition parties. Steven MacKinnon, the government house leader, warned the Liberals didn’t have the votes, and warned the country could face a Christmas election.\n\nOn Tuesday, however Chris d’Entremont, a Conservative MP, crossed the floor to the Liberals in response to the budget.\n\nD’Entremont, who represents a riding in Nova Scotia, told reporters his decision was partly a repudiation of Poilievre’s brusque leadership and suggested there were other disaffected Conservatives.\n\nHis defection was a key win for Carney’s Liberals, who govern with a parliamentary minority. With d’Entremont now sitting with the Liberals, the party needed the support of two lawmakers from other parties to pass this budget and avoid an election.\n\nThen on Thursday evening, as MPs were voting, Matt Jeneroux, a long-serving Edmonton MP, announced his surprise resignation just seven months after he was narrowly re-elected to “spend more time with his family”.\n\nHe later denied rumours he had been forced out of the Conservative caucus following speculation he was considering leaving the Tories after meeting privately with Carney.\n\n“There’s no way this is just a coincidence,” Mark Gerretsen, the government whip told reporters, adding Poilievre was seeing progressive lawmakers in his ranks “abandon” the party.\n\nRumours of discontent within the Conservative caucus have persisted, alongside reports that Liberals are looking to woo over disgruntled Tory MPs.\n\nCarney himself appeared more willing to play politics, telling reporters he would “speak to anyone publicly or otherwise” who might support his legislative goals.\n\n“Carney is not a lifelong politician and that was part of his appeal to voters in the spring election. He presents himself as being above the partisan games that characterize Canadian politics,” said Lori Turnbull, director of Dalhousie University’s school of public administration. But his decision to shift the Liberal party towards a focus on the economy, and fiscal responsibility helped him able to attract moderate conservatives.\n\n“They have a lot in common with Carney.”",

    "text": "China’s carbon dioxide emissions have been flat or falling for 18 months, analysis reveals, adding evidence to the hope that the world’s biggest polluter has managed to hit its target of peak CO 2 emissions well ahead of schedule.\n\nRapid increases in the deployment of solar and wind power generation – which grew by 46% and 11% respectively in the third quarter of this year – meant the country’s energy sector emissions remained flat, even as the demand for electricity increased.\n\nChina added 240GW of solar capacity in the first nine months of this year, and 61GW of wind, putting it on track for another renewable record in 2025. Last year, the country installed 333GW of solar power, more than the rest of the world combined.\n\nThe analysis by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (Crea), for the science and climate policy website Carbon Brief, found China’s CO 2 emissions were unchanged from a year earlier in the third quarter of 2025, thanks in part to declining emissions in the travel, cement and steel industries.\n\nThe findings come as global leaders gather in Brazil for Cop30, which is taking place against a backdrop of increasing urgency in the fight against the climate crisis. China’s president, Xi Jinping, did not attend the leaders summit at the UN climate conference, but the Chinese delegation are present for the talks. Xi’s US counterpart, Donald Trump, also did not attend and has not sent a negotiation team either.\n\nLast week, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, said the world was facing a “moral failure and deadly negligence” if governments failed to limit global heating to 1.5C.\n\nOn Monday, André Corrêa do Lago, the Brazilian diplomat and president of Cop30, praised Chinese progress on green technologies. “China is coming up with solutions that are for everyone, not just China,” he said, adding that rich countries had lost their enthusiasm for tackling the climate crisis.\n\n“Solar panels are cheaper, they’re so competitive [compared with fossil fuel energy] that they are everywhere now. If you’re thinking of climate change, this is good.”\n\nLauri Myllyvirta, the lead analyst at Crea, noted that China’s overall emissions trend for 2025 could still record a small rise, depending on what happened in the last quarter of the year. But assuming that 2025 follows the trend of previous years of Chinese electricity demand and associated emissions growing fastest in the summer months, then its CO 2 emissions could record a fall for the full year.\n\nChina’s dual carbon goals are peak emissions by 2030 and net neutrality by 2060. In September, the country released its latest climate targets, to cut overall greenhouse gas emissions by between 7% and 10% of their peak by 2035. Experts say those targets are too modest to stave off global catastrophe and a long way from the 30% cut that is feasible and necessary.\n\nBut China has a record of underpromising and overdelivering on climate targets. Li Shuo, the director of the China Climate Hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute, a US-based thinktank, said in a recent note that the latest Chinese climate targets should be seen as a baseline and not a ceiling.\n\nAlthough China is probably on track to reach its peak emissions target ahead of schedule, Myllyvirta said some areas of the economy were bucking the decarbonisation trend. Oil demand and emissions in the transport sector fell by 5% in the third quarter, but grew elsewhere by 10%, as the production of plastics and other chemicals surged.\n\nChina is also on track to miss its target for cutting carbon intensity – the CO2 emissions per unit of gross domestic product – between 2020 and 2025. This means steeper reductions will be necessary if the country is to hit its 2030 goal of reducing carbon intensity by 65%, compared with 2005.\n\nIn China, all eyes are now on the 15th five-year plan, which lays out the government’s priority and policies for the 2026-2030 period. The full text will not be published until next year but Chinese officials have hinted that low-carbon energy systems will be a focus of the plan.",

    "text": "The foreign affairs select committee is drawing up plans to examine Chinese government interference in academia as part of its inquiry into the UK’s strategy towards Beijing.\n\nMPs are broadening the scope of their investigation into the China audit, an internal government review of UK-China relations that concluded in June, to look into Chinese state influence at British universities.\n\nMinisters are under pressure to take a more robust approach after the Guardian disclosed that Sheffield Hallam University had blocked the work of a professor whose work was critical of China’s human rights record.\n\nSheffield Hallam banned one of its most prominent professors, Laura Murphy, from continuing with her work on China-linked supply chains, after years of pressure from the Chinese government.\n\nMurphy’s work focuses on Uyghurs, a persecuted Muslim minority in China, being co-opted into forced labour programmes. The Chinese government rejects accusations of forced labour, claiming Uyghur work programmes are for poverty alleviation.\n\nIn October, Sheffield Hallam lifted the ban, and apologised to Murphy. But the case has caused widespread alarm about the influence of the Chinese government on UK universities, both in the form of specific threats and fears of losing access to the lucrative market of Chinese international students.\n\nEmily Thornberry, the chair of the foreign affairs select committee, said: “From what we have heard so far, Chinese government interference in our universities is a threat. We need to examine the extent of it and universities should have a co-ordinated response to it”.\n\nLast week, the Sheffield Hallam branch of the University and College Union (UCU) and the national executive committee of the UCU passed motions calling for a “full public inquiry” into the events at Sheffield Hallam. The motions also called for a government-led review into the ways in which commercial considerations are eroding academic free speech.\n\nSimilar motions are expected to be tabled at regional UCU branches in the coming weeks.\n\nBob Jeffrey, a branch officer for the Sheffield Hallam UCU, said: “Laura’s case really resonates with UCU members”. Academics in the UK have spoken out about “extremely heaving” pressure from Beijing in the wake of the revelations about Sheffield Hallam.\n\nInternal emails from Sheffield Hallam revealed that Murphy’s work and the university’s business interests in China were considered to be “untenable bedfellows”. The university said the emails did not represent university policy and that the decision to block Murphy’s research was not based on commercial interests.\n\nSeparately, Sheffield Hallam has been referred to counter-terrorism police over concerns that it assisted a foreign intelligence service, in this case China, when it blocked Murphy’s research.\n\nStaff at Sheffield Hallam are going on strike on Tuesday amid concerns about job cuts and the university’s handling of Murphy’s case.\n\nJo Grady, the general secretary of the UCU, said: “It is incredibly worrying that Sheffield Hallam appears to have attempted to silence its own professor on behalf of a foreign government”.\n\nThere has been growing concern for years that the higher education sector’s dependence on international student fees from China is a vulnerability for universities.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Headlines UK Free newsletter Get the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They pay billions in tuition fees, which many universities see as an economic lifeline.\n\nCollaboration with Chinese students is also seen as beneficial to the UK’s own research output, particularly in science and technology fields, although some have warned of the security risks of certain types of joint research projects.\n\nIn 2023, parliament’s intelligence and security committee warned that China could gain political influence and economic advantages in the UK by “controlling the narrative of debate about China within UK universities” by exerting influence on academics and Chinese students.\n\nThe UK ranks at the top of a list of countries affected by Chinese government influence in academia on the China Index, a project by Doublethink Lab that monitors Chinese overseas influence.\n\nBeijing has reacted strongly to the reports about Sheffield Hallam, with one article in the state-run Global Times stating: “Western scholars essentially only have the freedom to express anti-China sentiments, not the right to conduct free research”.\n\nA spokesperson for the Chinese embassy said: “China firmly opposes activities by any institution or individual to slander and smear China by fabricating falsehoods and spreading lies.\n\n“The individual concerned has herself admitted to the media that she received funding and support from US government agencies and other sources to conduct this so-called ‘research’, which specifically aims at attacking China’s Xinjiang policies. It is evident that what she is doing is part of the disgraceful political campaign of defaming China under the disguise of ‘academic freedom’ or ‘freedom of speech’.”\n\nAdditional research by Lillian Yang",

    "text": "Indonesia has awarded former authoritarian leader Suharto the title of national hero, in a move that has sparked accusations of historical revisionism in the world’s third-largest democracy.\n\nThe award has deepened fears about attempts to whitewash Suharto’s rise and decades-long rule, a period marked by rampant corruption, censorship and accusations of mass human rights violations.\n\nThe title was conferred in a ceremony on Monday morning presided over by President Prabowo Subianto, Suharto’s ex-son-in-law, despite protests by pro-democracy activists and the families of those affected by the strongman’s iron-fisted rule.\n\nView image in fullscreen President Prabowo Subianto hands a plaque to Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana, Suharto’s daughter, at the state palace in Jakarta. Photograph: Ajeng Dinar Ulfiana/Reuters\n\n“A prominent figure from Central Java province, a hero of the struggle for independence, General Suharto stood out since the independence era,” an announcer said as Prabowo handed the award to Suharto’s daughter and son.\n\nIndonesia gained independence in 1945 from then colonial powers Netherlands and Japan.\n\nSuharto, who ruled Indonesia for more than three decades, was forced from power amid mass protests and deadly riots during an economic crisis in 1998. He died in 2006 aged 86.\n\nPrabowo, who married and later divorced Suharto’s daughter Siti Hediati Hariyadi, has in the past openly praised his former father-in-law, and himself drawn criticism for the increasing prominence of the military in civilian life since he assumed office last year.\n\nView image in fullscreen Riot police in Jakarta beating back protesters with rattan sticks in December 1998.

Prabowo has always denied wrongdoing in relation to the claims.\n\nDefending the bestowal of hero status on Suharto, Indonesia’s culture minister, Fadli Zon, said Suharto was worthy of the award because of the military operations he was involved in, including fighting against the Dutch in 1949. He denied that Suharto was involved in the massacre of at least half a million suspected Communists in 1965-66.\n\nBut Indonesian activists have described the elevation of Suharto as shocking.\n\nView image in fullscreen A protester sorts posters at a rally last week against Indonesia granting Suharto national hero status. Photograph: Achmad Ibrahim/AP\n\n“How could the man most responsible for one of history’s greatest genocides, when he seized power, be made a national hero? It’s utterly absurd,” said Usman Hamid of Amnesty International Indonesia.\n\n“It is a blatant whitewashing of historical crimes. This decision ignores the aspirations of civil society, including victims of human rights violations who continue to demand justice.”\n\nThe government did not immediately provide comment to these claims.\n\nTalk of naming Suharto a national hero has also sparked protests in Jakarta, where in recent days demonstrators have rallied near the presidential palace holding signs saying “Stop the whitewashing of the general of butchery” and “Thousands died but the country chose to forget”.",

The weather system prompted warnings for heavy rainfall and life-threatening storm surges across much of the country, with sustained winds of 115mph (185km/h) and gusts of about 140mph recorded on Sunday by the national meteorological agency.\n\nBy the time Fung-Wong moves past the Philippines early this week, more than 200mm of rainfall is expected to have fallen on Luzon, the country’s most populous island.\n\nThis follows Typhoon Kalmaegi, which struck less than a week ago and left at least 224 people dead in the Philippines. The arrival of Typhoon Fung-Wong has forced authorities to suspend rescue operations for more than 100 missing people.\n\nAfter crossing Luzon, Fung-Wong is expected to move north-westwards into the South China Sea by Tuesday, before veering north towards Taiwan. Although there is some variability in its track, Taiwan is likely to face heavy rain, strong winds and flooding midweek.\n\nMeanwhile, parts of south-western Europe will experience heavy rain, particularly across the Iberian peninsula. Cumulative rainfall by the end of the week will exceed 100mm across western Portugal and Spain’s Galicia region, with totals exceeding 200mm more locally. Strong winds are also expected on Tuesday as gusts top 60mph.\n\nView image in fullscreen An iguana, stunned from the cold, is retrieved after falling from a tree in West Palm Beach, Florida. Photograph: Greg Lovett/Zuma/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nAcross the Atlantic, the south-eastern US is braced for its first significant cold spell of the season as polar air pushes south. Temperatures in northern Florida are expected to drop about 15C (30F) below the average for the time of year. After a warm weekend – with highs in the Florida panhandle approaching 30C on Saturday – a plunge to about 0C 7am local time on Tuesday will come as a shock.\n\nOne striking – and unusual – consequence of this sharp temperature drop is that local iguanas are expected to succumb to the frigid conditions and fall from the trees where they usually perch. As cold-blooded reptiles, iguanas become temporarily paralysed when temperatures dip below 10C, causing them to lose their grip. Authorities have issued warnings, particularly for Tuesday morning, urging people to watch out for falling iguanas from trees and other unexpected places.",

Searches for those still missing had to be suspended on Sunday due to safety concerns for rescue workers.\n\nAt least two deaths from Typhoon Fung-wong were recorded before landfall on Sunday. The civil defence office reported that one person drowned in Catanduanes and a woman was trapped by a collapsed home in Catbalogan City. Juniel Tagarino, a rescuer in Catbalogan City, said the body of the 64-year-old woman, who had been trying to leave, had been pulled from under debris and fallen trees.\n\n“The wind was so strong and the rain was heavy … According to her family members, she might have forgotten something and went back inside her house,” Tagarino said.\n\nThe biggest typhoon to threaten the Philippines in years, Fung-wong could cover two-thirds of the archipelago with a 1,118-mile-wide rain and wind band, forecasters have said. Tropical cyclones with sustained winds of 115mph (185km/h) or higher are categorised in the Philippines as a super-typhoon, a designation adopted to underscore the urgency tied to more extreme weather disturbances.\n\nScientists have said storms are becoming more powerful due to the human-driven climate crisis. Warmer oceans allow typhoons to strengthen rapidly and a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, meaning heavier rainfall.\n\nMore than 1.2 million people have been pre-emptively evacuated across the country, Rafaelito Alejandro, a civil defence deputy administrator, told a news briefing.\n\nTyphoon Fung-wong is expected to bring at least 200mm (8in) of rain to many parts of the country, according to government meteorologists. It is the 21st significant storm to hit the Philippines this year, straining disaster response efforts across the country.\n\nIt blew into Dinalungan town in Aurora province on Sunday night after fierce rain and wind in north-eastern Philippine provinces all day from offshore.\n\nIn Aurora province, Aries Ora, 34, a government worker, said the rain was still light as he boarded up his home in the town of Dipaculao with steel sheets and wooden boards during daylight hours before landfall, but he said he feared the dark. “What really scares us is that the expected landfall is at night,” he said. “Unlike previous typhoons, we won’t be able to clearly see the movement of the wind and what’s happening around us.”\n\nSchools and government offices have been ordered to close on Monday across Luzon, including in the capital, Manila, where nearly 300 flights have been cancelled.\n\nView image in fullscreen Rescuers evacuate people in Sablayan, Occidental Mindoro province. Photograph: AP\n\nGilberto Teodoro, the defence secretary, urged people in the storm’s path to obey evacuation orders, saying that to not comply was dangerous and unlawful.\n\n“We ask that people pre-emptively evacuate so that we don’t end up having to conduct rescues at the last minute, which could put the lives of police, soldiers, firefighters and coastguard personnel at risk,” he said.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, Catanduanes, a small island that the state weather service said could take a direct hit, was already being lashed by wind and rain, with storm surges sending waves hurtling over streets and flood waters rising in some areas.\n\nAlejandro said: “As we speak they are feeling the impact of the typhoon, especially in Catanduanes, because the storm’s eye is closest there.”\n\nEdson Casarino, 33, who lives in the town of Virac in Catanduanes, said: “The waves started roaring around 7am. When the waves hit the seawall, it felt like the ground was shaking.”\n\nVideo from officials in Catanduanes, shared by the government broadcaster, showed houses submerged up to the roofs.\n\n“The rain and wind were so strong there was nearly zero visibility,” Roberto Monterola, a disaster mitigation officer for Catanduanes, told the Associated Press by telephone.\n\nIn Guinobatan, a town of about 80,000 people in Albay province, verified video showed streets transformed into raging torrents.\n\nView image in fullscreen An area affected by Typhoon Fung-wong in Catanduanes province.

I pray for the deceased and their families, for the injured and the displaced,” he said on Sunday.\n\nFung-Wong is expected to head north of the Philippines and reach coastal waters on Monday morning while remaining a typhoon, before heading out to sea and weakening as it reaches west Taiwan on Thursday.\n\nAgence France-Press and Reuters contributed to this report",

Share Updated at 22.32 EST\n\n19m ago 22.35 EST Penry Buckley NSW attorney general believes new protest laws will not be affected by supreme court decision The NSW attorney general, Michael Daley, says he believes the government’s second attempt to restrict protests outside places of worship will not be captured by a supreme court decision striking down earlier laws. In question time, he told parliament it was never the government’s intention to restrict peaceful protests “that happened to be near a place of worship”. The earlier law gave police the power to move on protesters who were “in or near” a place of worship. Daley said: The supreme court’s decision did not affect the offence of intentionally blocking, impeding, harassing, intimidating or threatening a person accessing a place of worship, and that is important … The amendments in the bill balance community protections with the freedom of political expression, sometimes that is difficult. The premier and the police minister, Yasmin Catley, have continued to field questions about why they were not aware of Saturday’s neo-Nazi rally before it happened, and whether anyone in their offices was warned, but have repeated earlier denials. It comes after the NSW speaker, Greg Piper, and NSW police deputy commissioner Peter Thurtell revealed that they were advised about the rally before it took place.

The new Booker prize winner has been announced Hungarian-British author David Szalay has won the 2025 Booker prize for his novel Flesh. Szalay’s sixth work of fiction traces the life of one man, István, from his youth to midlife. The judges “had never read anything quite like it”, said the panel chair, Roddy Doyle, who won the prize in 1993. “It is, in many ways, a dark book, but it is a joy to read.” View image in fullscreen David Szalay, author of Flesh. Photograph: James Shaw/Shutterstock Flesh opens with a shocking incident that unfolds while teenage István is living in an apartment complex with his mother in Hungary. Szalay then follows the protagonist as he spends time in the military before moving to London, where he begins working for the uber-rich. Written in spare prose, the novel explores masculinity, class, migration, trauma, sex and power. Szalay was announced as the winner of the £50,000 (A$100,000) award at a ceremony held in Old Billingsgate in London on Monday evening. He was previously shortlisted for the prize in 2016, for his novel All That Man Is.

The Albanese government on 1 October lifted the price caps below which Australians could apply to buy a home with a government-backed guarantee on small deposits. Caps lifted by at least $150,000 in the big cities, with metropolitan New South Wales rising by $600,000. Properties with values within the new caps saw prices rise 1.2% in the month of October, while those outside the price caps rose 1%, according to data firm Cotality. That gap represents thousands of dollars’ difference, given the national median home price rose nearly $10,000 in the month, to $872,538. It may not all have come from the expanded deposit scheme, but it did coincide with a rapid uptick in applications – which doubled at Westpac in October 2025 compared with October 2024 – and approvals under the scheme, with purchases 50% higher in October 2025 than October 2024, according to government data. Treasury advised the government as recently as July the scheme would support about 70,000 home purchases a year and boost house prices by 0.6% over six years, officials told Senate estimates last week.

The case will have 139 prosecution witnesses, with efforts to reduce these numbers stalled because Jones would not say which senior counsel he had briefed. Defence solicitor Bryan Wrench said his client would also call his own witnesses, saying “we believe there is an iceberg of exculpatory material”.

Bruhn and his friend, Patrick Sinnott, faced Geelong magistrates court on Tuesday, where the rape and intentional sexual touching charges were formally withdrawn. Bruhn’s identity was previously suppressed, but his barrister asked for the order to be lifted after the prosecution’s application. Both men have always maintained their innocence. Bruhn’s barrister, Dermot Dann, told the court the woman had since admitted she lied and the case was clearly a “horrible stain on the criminal justice system”. “(Bruhn) should be regarded now and forever as someone who was 100 per cent innocent,” Dann said on Tuesday.

The energy project is run by Akaysha Energy and sits on the former site of the Munmorah coal-fired power station on NSW’s Central Coast. When completed, it’s expected to have a full capacity of 850MW, enough to power nearly 1m homes for one hour. View image in fullscreen The Waratah Super Battery. Photograph: Strategic Communications and Engagement EnergyCo Akaysha said two of three transformers on the site were found to have issues during testing to bring the battery fully online. The two transformers are undergoing detailed engineering inspections to figure out how to move forward. A spokesperson for the energy company said: The Waratah Super Battery is still operating at 350MW capacity and actively bolstering energy security for NSW’s grid. The Waratah Super Battery continues to meet its System Integrity Protection Scheme (SIPS) service requirements of 350MW, which is the interim commercial operating capacity. The battery’s remaining capacity is expected to come online during 2026.

Analysts had expected Westpac’s latest monthly sentiment survey to show deepening gloom among consumers. Instead, the report revealed optimists outnumbered pessimists for the first time since early 2022, underpinned by a jump in confidence about the prospects for the economy and households’ finances. In positive news for retailers ahead of Christmas, there was a big lift in buyer sentiment, somewhat offset by a “patchy” mood about households’ current financial position. View image in fullscreen Photograph: Lisa Maree Williams/Getty Images Matthew Hassan, a senior economist at Westpac, said overall the lift in consumer confidence was “an extraordinary and somewhat surprising result”, in the context of the rebound in inflation. That said, “sentiment overall is still only marginally positive rather than strongly optimistic,” Hassan said. In contrast, those respondents with mortgages were more pessimistic in November than in October, as hopes for further rate cuts dwindled.

On Tuesday, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau released its final report into the two incidents, which took place in September 2023 while a Melbourne airport runway was temporarily shortened for resurfacing works. In the first incident on 7 September that year, a Malaysia Airlines Airbus A330-300 with 247 people on board overran the runway while taking off for a flight to Kuala Lumpur, passing less than 7 metres above workers and construction vehicles. Eleven days later, a Bamboo Airways Boeing 787-9 also lifted off beyond the temporary end of the runway, narrowly missing workers by 4.5 metres. No physical injuries were recorded and the planes continued with their planned flights. ATSB’s investigation found that flight crew expectations, workload and time pressure meant that critical information relating to the runway length was received but not absorbed or factored into their take-off calculations. The ATSB’s chief commissioner, Angus Mitchell, said the incidents were very serious and “it was by luck in this case that we didn’t have an impact”: Thankfully, no workers were physically injured as the jet blasts impacted the works area, but this was a terrifying event for those on the ground … The risk controls in place at the time to prevent occurrences such as this were procedural in nature. Whilst it is a fundamental part of responsibility to review and correctly understand all relevant information when preparing for a flight, these and previous incidents show that this process is susceptible to human error, considering the potentially catastrophic consequences of a loaded and fully fuelled aircraft impacting a work site on takeoff. The incidents have prompted changes to domestic and international practices on notifying flight crews about critical information to reduce the capacity for human error in take-off procedures.

    "text": "Two passenger planes only narrowly avoided colliding with construction vehicles and workers during takeoff at Melbourne airport in 2023, in one case by less than five metres, because the flight crews were unaware the runway was nearly 1,600m shorter than usual, an Australian safety investigation has found.\n\nThe incidents, described as “terrifying” for workers on the ground, have prompted changes to domestic and international practices on notifying flight crews about critical safety information to reduce the potential for human error in takeoff.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau released its final report into the incidents, which occurred in September 2023, when two planes overshot the end of the same runway on takeoff, 11 days apart.\n\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\n\nThe runway had been temporarily shortened from 3,657 metres to 2,089 metres to allow for night-time resurfacing works.\n\nIn the first incident on 7 September, a Malaysia Airlines Airbus A330-300 with 247 people on board overran the runway while taking off for a flight to Kuala Lumpur, passing less than seven metres above workers and construction vehicles.\n\nEleven days later, a Bamboo Airways Boeing 787-9 bound for Hanoi also lifted off beyond the temporary end of the runway, narrowly missing workers by 4.5 metres.\n\nNo physical injuries were recorded and the planes continued with their planned flights.\n\nThe ATSB’s investigation found the flight crews had not absorbed or factored critical information about the changes to the runway length into their takeoff calculations due to expectations, workload and time pressures.\n\n“These were serious incidents,” the ATSB chief commissioner, Angus Mitchell, said. “In both cases we had a fully loaded and fuelled aircraft with over 200 personnel on board coming within metres of fixed equipment on the ground and with works equipment. So it was by luck in this case that we didn’t have an impact.”\n\nThe ATSB investigation found flight crews had been notified of the changes to the runway via written reports and the airport’s automatic terminal information service, an audio loop accessed as a standard part of flight planning procedures.\n\nThe dispatchers, who brief flight crews, also accounted for the shortened runway distance when calculating whether the planes could take off as planned. However, because it did not result in changes to logistics such as weight distribution, only the level of thrust required for takeoff – which is the pilot’s responsibility to calculate – the dispatchers did not specifically draw the flight crew’s attention to the runway length.\n\nThe Malaysia Airlines crew told investigators their focus before takeoff had been on taxiway closures, while the Bamboo Airways crew said they had been experiencing a high workload due to repeated power outages and felt under time pressure to depart.\n\nMitchell said the risk controls in place at the time were “procedural in nature”.\n\n“These and previous incidents show that this process is susceptible to human error, considering the potentially catastrophic consequences of a loaded and fully fuelled aircraft impacting a work site on takeoff,” he said.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Breaking News Australia Free newsletter Get the most important news as it breaks Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

    "text": "The Victorian government should ramp up train services in Melbourne’s north and west, extend eight tram routes and create six new express bus services within the next five years, the state’s independent infrastructure adviser has recommended.\n\nInfrastructure Victoria’s 30-year plan also calls for off-peak public transport to be made cheaper and for collaboration with the commonwealth to introduce a road user charge, after a previous state levy on electric vehicles was ruled unconstitutional by the high court.\n\nThe body says the 45 final recommendations, released on Tuesday, are needed to respond to climate change which threatens “buildings, roads and power lines” as well as population growth.\n\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\n\nThe government has set a target of 800,000 new homes to be built in Victoria by 2034, with 70% of new homes in established suburbs. The state’s population – estimated at 6.9 million by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in 2024 – is forecast to increase by 4 million people in the next 30 years.\n\nThe changes are also designed to make the most of Melbourne’s new Metro Tunnel which is due to begin taking passengers in December.\n\nView image in fullscreen Infrastructure Victoria says without more northern train services, more residents in Coburg and Brunswick could soon be forced to drive to work. Illustration: Infrastructure Victoria\n\nInfrastructure Victoria chief executive, Dr Jonathan Spear, said the report, which calls for a $65bn spend over three decades, was predicated on “how can we make best use of those investments that we’ve made already”, including existing infrastructure.\n\nSome of the recommendations, including reducing speed limits to 30km/h in areas with children and the creation of separated bicycle corridors in Melbourne, Geelong, Ballarat, Bendigo and Wangaratta, were made public in a draft plan in March.\n\nBut after feedback, a new recommendation has called for changes which would allow more train services to run in Melbourne’s north, with modelling showing many residents of suburbs including Coburg and Brunswick could soon be forced to drive to work.\n\nThe report says they already wait up to 20 minutes for trains during peak times, four to five times longer than stations in Melbourne’s south-east located a similar distance from the CBD. Trams on Sydney Road are up to 27% slower than the network average due to mixed traffic and predicted to get 4% slower by 2041.\n\nInfrastructure Victoria says upgrades to power and signalling in the City Loop, where space has been freed up by the Metro Tunnel, and building an extra track on the Upfield line, would allow nine trains to run an hour rather than four.\n\nIt has also modelled tram extensions that make the most of capacity changes created by the Metro Tunnel’s new stations, calling for the expansion of eight routes over five years at a cost of up to $5.7bn, to encourage the construction of more new homes nearby.\n\nView image in fullscreen Infrastructure Victoria has recommended the extension of eight Melbourne tram routes by 2031, including long-promised connections to Chadstone and Fishermans Bend. Photograph: Infrastructure Victoria\n\nThat includes linking routes 11 and 67 to Fishermans Bend, where the government plans for 80,000 people to live by 2050, and extending route 3 to Hughesdale via Chadstone. Tram services to Fishermans Bend and Chadstone were promised in 2018 but have not eventuated.\n\nThe report also identifies Melbourne’s rapidly growing west as poorly served by buses and metropolitan trains, with 63% of residents driving to work compared with 32% in inner Melbourne.\n\nIt has called for the extension of Metro train services to Melton, additional tracks from Sunshine to Caroline Springs, as well as new train stations at Thornhill Park, Mount Atkinson and Altona North.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Breaking News Australia Free newsletter Get the most important news as it breaks Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Infrastructure Victoria\n\nAnother recommendation is charging lower fares for off-peak travel, with Infrastructure Victoria’s research showing bus passenger numbers can increase by up to 19% for every $1 fare discount. It also calls for the expansion of bus and coach routes and services in regional areas and cities.\n\n“While some people get excited about the idea of passenger rail services to some of Victoria’s smaller regional cities, our modelling and analysis shows they are probably not viable. But some high-quality coach services are,” said Spear.\n\nThe review’s 45 recommendations for the next five years cover transport, health, housing, energy, water, social infrastructure and the environment.\n\nIt has also advised on eight changes Victoria will probably need in the next 30 years but do not necessarily require immediate action.\n\nThe report will be tabled in parliament this week, with the government obliged to respond to the recommendations within a year.",

    "text": "It is the $1.4tn (£1.1tn) question. How can a loss-making startup such as OpenAI afford such a staggering spending commitment?\n\nAnswer that positively and it will go a long way to easing investor concerns over bubble warnings in the artificial intelligence boom, from lofty tech company valuations to a mooted $3tn global spend on datacentres.\n\nThe company behind ChatGPT needs a vast amount of computing power – or compute, in tech jargon – to train its models, produce their responses and build even more powerful systems in the future. The cost of its compute commitment – the AI infrastructure such as chips and servers that power its world famous chatbot – is $1.4tn over the next eight years, a figure that dwarfs its $13bn in annual revenues.\n\nOver the past week this gap has appeared chasm-like, becoming a backdrop to market nerves over AI spending and statements by OpenAI executives that did little to answer concerns.\n\nSam Altman, the OpenAI chief executive, first attempted to deal with it in an awkward exchange with a leading investor in the company, Brad Gerstner of Altimeter Capital, that ended with Altman ordering: “enough”.\n\nSpeaking on his podcast with Altman last month, Gerstner described the company’s ability to pay for more than $1tn in compute costs, while revenue is running at $13bn a year, as a question “hanging over the market”.\n\nAltman responded: “First of all, we’re doing well more revenue than that. Second of all, Brad if you want to sell your shares, I’ll find you a buyer. I just, enough.”\n\nThen last week the OpenAI chief financial officer, Sarah Friar, suggested that the US government could underwrite some of the chip spending.\n\n“This is where we’re looking for an ecosystem of banks, private equity, maybe even governmental, the ways governments can come to bear,” she told the Wall Street Journal, adding that such a guarantee “can really drop the cost of financing”.\n\nWas OpenAI, which recently announced it is becoming a fully fledged for-profit company worth $500bn, really saying that AI companies should be treated like banks in the late 2000s? This triggered immediate attempts at clarification from Friar, who took to LinkedIn to deny that OpenAI was seeking a federal backstop, while Altman sought to set the record straight on X.\n\nIn a long post, Altman wrote “we do not have or want government guarantees for OpenAI datacenters”, adding that taxpayers should not bail out companies that make “bad business decisions”. Instead, perhaps, the government should build its own AI infrastructure and give loan guarantees to support chip manufacturing in the US.\n\nBenedict Evans, a tech analyst, says OpenAI is trying to match the other big AI players such as Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta, Google and Microsoft – itself a leading backer of OpenAI – which are supported by their already hugely profitable business models.\n\n“OpenAI wants to match or exceed the infrastructure – the tens and hundreds of billions of dollars of compute – of the big platform companies. But those companies have cashflows from their existing businesses to pay for this and OpenAI does not, so it’s trying to bootstrap its way into the club,” he says.\n\nView image in fullscreen Altman believes that $1.4tn can be paid off by future demand for OpenAI products and by ever-improving models. Photograph: Stephen Brashear/AP\n\nThere are also questions over the circular nature of some of OpenAI’s compute deals. For instance, Oracle will spend $300bn building new datacentres for OpenAI in Texas, New Mexico, Michigan and Wisconsin – and OpenAI will then pay back roughly the same amount to use those datacentres. Under the terms of a transaction with Nvidia, the leading maker of the chips that AI companies use, OpenAI will pay Nvidia in cash for chips, and Nvidia will invest in OpenAI for non-controlling shares.\n\nAltman also addressed the revenue issue, writing that OpenAI expects to end the year above $20bn in annualised revenue and then grow to “hundreds of billion[s]” by 2030.\n\nHe added: “Based on the trends we are seeing of how people are using AI and how much of it they would like to use, we believe the risk of OpenAI of not having enough computing power is more significant and more likely than the risk of having too much.”\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It makes its revenues from ChatGPT subscriptions for consumers – which account for 75% of its income – and offering businesses its corporate versions of ChatGPT, while also allowing companies and start ups to build their own products with its AI models.\n\nOne Silicon Valley investor, who does not have a financial interest in OpenAI, says OpenAI can build on its popularity but its success is contingent on factors such as the models improving, the cost of operating them getting cheaper and the chips used to power them becoming less costly.\n\n“The belief is that OpenAI can leverage its strong brand and ChatGPT’s position as a popular choice among consumers and businesses to build a suite of high value and high margin products. The question is at what scale can they build out these products and revenue models and how good can these models get,” says the investor.\n\nBut it is loss-making. OpenAI says reporting of its losses, including reports that it lost $8bn in the first half of the year and about $12bn in the third quarter, are inaccurate, although it does not deny it loses money or provide alternative figures.\n\nAltman believes the revenue will come from a number of sources. For instance: growing demand for paid-for versions of ChatGPT; other companies using its datacentres; people buying the hardware devices it is building with iPhone designer Sir Jony Ive; and that “huge value” will be created by AI’s achievements in scientific research.\n\nSo that is the bet: OpenAI needs $1.4tn worth of compute, a number dwarfing its current revenues, because it believes demand and ever better iterations of its products will pay it off.\n\nCarl Benedikt Frey, author of How Progress Ends and the associate professor of AI and work at Oxford University, is sceptical about OpenAI’s hopes and points to recent evidence of a slowdown in AI adoption in the world’s largest economy. The US Census Bureau, for instance, reported that AI adoption has been declining in recent months among companies with more than 250 employees.\n\n“On various measures AI adoption has been falling in the US since the summer. We do not know exactly why, but it does suggest that we are at a stage where some users and businesses feel they are not quite getting what they hoped for from AI so far,” says Frey, adding that without “new breakthroughs” at the company he does not see it reaching $100bn in revenue by 2027 – a figure Altman has hinted at.\n\nOpenAI says it is seeing accelerating business adoption, with the corporate version of ChatGPT growing nine times year over year as it gains customers from an array of sectors including banking, life sciences and manufacturing.\n\nAltman acknowledged on X, nonetheless, that the bet might not pay off.\n\n“But of course we could be wrong, and the market – not the government – will deal with it if we are.”",

    "text": "The computer interrupted while Pamela was still speaking. I had accompanied her – my dear friend – to a recent doctor’s appointment. She is in her 70s, lives alone while navigating multiple chronic health issues, and has been getting short of breath climbing the front stairs to her apartment. In the exam room, she spoke slowly and self-consciously, the way people often do when they are trying to describe their bodies and anxieties to strangers. Midway through her description of how she had been feeling, the doctor clicked his mouse and a block of text began to bloom across the computer monitor.\n\nThe clinic had adopted an artificial-intelligence scribe, and it was transcribing and summarizing the conversation in real time. It was also highlighting keywords, suggesting diagnostic possibilities and providing billing codes. The doctor, apparently satisfied that his computer had captured an adequate description of Pamela’s chief complaint and symptoms, turned away from us and began reviewing the text on the screen as Pamela kept speaking.\n\nWhen the appointment was over, as a physician myself and anthropologist interested in the evolving culture of medicine, I asked if I could glance at the AI-generated note. The summary was surprisingly fluid and accurate. But it did not capture the catch in Pamela’s voice when she mentioned the stairs, the flicker of fear when she implied that she now avoided them and avoided going out, the unspoken connection to Pamela’s traumatic relation to her own mother’s death that the doctor never elicited.\n\nSoon, not using AI to help determine diagnoses or treatments could be seen as malpractice Craig Spencer\n\nScenes like this are becoming increasingly common. Physicians, for generations, have resisted new technologies that threatened their authority or unsettled established practice. But artificial intelligence is breaking that tradition by sweeping into clinical practice faster than almost any tool before it. Two-thirds of American physicians – a 78% jump from the year prior – and 86% of health systems used artificial intelligence as part of their practice in 2024. “AI will be as common in healthcare as the stethoscope,” predicts Dr Robert Pearl, the former CEO of Permanente Medical Group, one of the largest physician groups in the country. As my colleague Craig Spencer has observed: “Soon, not using AI to help determine diagnoses or treatments could be seen as malpractice.”\n\nPolicymakers and aligned business interests promise AI will solve physician burnout, lower healthcare costs and expand access. Entrepreneurs tout it as the great equalizer, bringing high-quality care to people excluded from existing systems. Hospital and physician leaders such as Dr Eric Topol have hailed AI as the means by which humanity will finally be restored to clinical practice; according to this widely embraced argument, it will liberate doctors from documentation drudgery and allow them to finally turn away from their computer screens and look patients in the eye. Meanwhile, patients are already making use of AI chatbots as supplements to – or substitutes for – doctors in what many see as a democratization of medical knowledge.\n\nThe problem is that when it is installed in a health sector that prizes efficiency, surveillance and profit extraction, AI becomes not a tool for care and community but simply another instrument for commodifying human life.\n\nIt is true that large language models can churn through mountains of medical literature, generate tidy summaries, and even outperform human physicians on diagnostic reasoning tasks in some studies. Last month, a new artificial intelligence system from OpenEvidence became the first AI to score 100% on the United States Medical Licensing Exam. Research suggests AI can read radiologic images with accuracy rivaling human specialists, detect skin cancers from smartphone photos, and flag early signs of sepsis in hospitalized patients faster than clinical teams. During the Covid-19 pandemic, AI models were deployed to predict surges and allocate scarce resources, fueling hopes that similar systems could optimize everything from ICU beds to medication supply chains.\n\nWhat makes AI so compelling is not simply faith in technology but the way it suggests we can improve medicine by leapfrogging the difficult work of structural change to confront disease-causing inequality, corporate interests and oligarchic power.\n\nThe US is the most medicalized country on Earth. Incentivized by profit, it spends roughly twice as much per capita on healthcare as other high-income nations, while simultaneously excluding millions from it and suffering – across all income levels – from far higher rates of preventable disease, disability and death. At the same time, public health scholars have long argued that medicine alone cannot fix what ails us at a population level. Instead, much more attention and public investment must be directed towards non-medical social care that is essential for preventing disease, lowering preventable healthcare needs and costs, and enabling medical interventions to be effective.\n\nFor many, tackling the perversity of American healthcare feels out of reach as the US lurches ever further into authoritarianism. In this context, AI is offered as a balm not because it addresses root causes of abysmal US public health, but because it allows policymakers and corporations to gloss over them.\n\nThis faith in AI also reflects a misunderstanding of care itself, a misunderstanding decades in the making in the service of an idea now treated as an unquestionable good: evidence-based medicine (EBM). Emerging in the 1990s with the unassailable goal of improving care, EBM challenged practices based on habit and tradition by insisting decisions be grounded in rigorous research, ideally randomized controlled trials. First championed at McMaster University by physicians David Sackett and Gordon Guyatt, EBM quickly hardened into orthodoxy, embedded in curricula, accreditation standards and performance metrics that reshaped clinical judgment into compliance with statistical averages and confidence intervals. The gains were real: effective therapies spread faster, outdated ones were abandoned, and an ethic of scientific accountability took hold.\n\nBut as the model transformed medicine, it narrowed the scope of clinical encounters. The messy, relational and interpretive dimensions of care – the ways physicians listen, intuit and elicit what patients may not initially say – were increasingly seen as secondary to standardized protocols. Doctors came to treat not singular people but data points. Under pressure for efficiency, EBM ossified into an ideology: “best practices” became whatever could be measured, tabulated and reimbursed. The complexity of patients’ lives was crowded out by metrics, checkboxes and algorithms. What began as a corrective to medicine’s biases paved the way for a new myopia: the conviction that medicine can and should be reduced to numbers.\n\nThe loss of the unsaid\n\nThe uses of AI do not just affect how we listen but also how we think and speak about ourselves, particularly as patients. Not long ago, a young woman came to see me, in my capacity as a psychiatrist, for chronic fatigue and associated experiences of sadness, anxiety and loss. She had experienced many rounds of dismissal by other doctors to whom she had appealed for help. Along the way, she developed strategies to try to avoid the experiences of humiliation she associated with doctors’ offices. One of those strategies: using ChatGPT to refine her narrative of herself. In the week leading up to her appointment with me, she had already told her story at least 10 times to the ChatGPT app she had installed on her phone. She had described her headaches, her racing heart in the early morning, the exhaustion that did not ease with rest. Each time, the bot responded in calm, fluent medical language, naming diagnostic possibilities and suggesting next steps. She refined her answers with each attempt, learning which words elicited which responses, as if she were studying for an exam.\n\nWhen she spoke to me, she used the same phrasing ChatGPT had given back to her: precise, clinical, flattened language largely stripped of affect or reference to her personal history, relationships and desires. Her deep fears were now encased in borrowed phrases, translated into a format she thought I would recognize as legitimate medical concerns, take seriously and address.\n\nIt is true that her efforts made bureaucratic documentation easy. But much else was lost in the process. Her own uncertainty, distrust of her own self-perception and body, and her life history and idiosyncratic way of making sense of her suffering had been sanded away, leaving a smooth, ready-made medical discourse ready for transcription and transmission to pharmacists and insurance companies. In the hands of a clinician practicing EBM predicated on symptom scales, a reflexive prescription for antidepressants or stimulants – or a battery of tests for endocrine or autoimmune diseases – might have seemed the natural response.\n\nBut those interventions, while perhaps later appropriate, would have skated over the deeper social and personal roots of her exhaustion. My patient’s AI-distorted narrative of herself thus not only obscured her experience but it also risked directing her care down a path of algorithmic pseudo-fixes that carry considerable risk of unintended harm.\n\nAI views both suffering and care as computational problems\n\nThis encounter has been replicated in various forms with several other patients I have met over the last year as AI tools have rapidly infiltrated everyday life. One man in his late 60s, retired after a lucrative business career, divorced, estranged from his two adult sons and enmeshed in an abusive relationship came to me struggling with profound loneliness, regret and severe alcohol dependence, punctuated by panic attacks so severe he feared he might die alone of a heart attack in his downtown high-rise condo. Before seeing me, he had spent weeks using ChatGPT as a therapist to great effect, he told me. He spent hours every day writing to it about his symptoms and past, and taking comfort in its consistently complimentary replies that assured him he had been wronged by others in his life.\n\nChatGPT had become not only his counselor but his main source of companionship. By the time we met, he fluently named his attachment style and the personality disorders ChatGPT had assigned to his family members, and repeated treatment suggestions – none of which addressed his daily consumption of a fifth of vodka. When I asked how he was feeling, he hesitated, then looked down at his phone in his hand as if to check whether his words matched what the psychological profile ChatGPT had laid out for him. The machine had substituted for both his voice and the human connection he craved.\n\nWe risk entering a perverse loop: machines are supplying the language with which patients relay their suffering, and doctors are using machines to record and respond to that suffering. This cultivates what psychologists call “cognitive miserliness”, or a tendency to default to the most readily available answer rather than engage in critical inquiry or self-reflection. By outsourcing thought, and ultimately the most intimate definitions of ourselves to AI, doctors and patients risk becoming yet further alienated from one another.\n\nIn this trajectory we can see the evolution of what Michel Foucault described in The Birth of the Clinic as the “medical gaze” – the separation and isolation of the diseased body from the lived experience of the person and their social environment. Where the 19th-century gaze fragmented the patient into lesions and signs visible to the clinician, and the late 20th-century evidence-based gaze translated patients into odds ratios and treatment protocols, the 21st-century algorithmic gaze dissolves both patient and doctor alike into never-ending streams of automated data. AI views both suffering and care as computational problems.\n\nThe arguments in support of this transformation of the clinic are familiar. Human physicians misdiagnose, while algorithms can catch subtle patterns invisible to the eye. Humans forget the latest science; algorithms can absorb every new article the instant it is published. Physicians burn out, but algorithms never tire. Such claims are true in a narrow sense. But the leap from these advantages to a wholesale embrace of AI as medicine’s future depends on dangerously simplistic assumptions.\n\nThe first is that AI is more objective than human physicians. In reality, AI is no less biased; it is merely biased differently, and in ways harder to detect. Models rely on existing datasets, which reflect decades of systemic inequities: from racial biases baked into kidney and lung-function tests to the underrepresentation of women and minorities in clinical trials. Pulse oximeters, for example, systematically underestimate hypoxemia in people with darker skin tones; during the Covid pandemic, these errors fed into triage algorithms, delaying care for Black patients. Race-based corrections for kidney function long influenced transplant eligibility across the country. Once such biases are embedded in protocols, they persist for years.\n\nThese problems are compounded by the assumption that more data automatically translates to better care. But no amount of data will repair underfunded clinics, reverse physician shortages or protect patients from predatory insurers.\n\nAI threatens to deepen these problems, obscuring discriminatory and profit-driven policies behind a sheen of computational neutrality. Emerging AI tools are ultimately controlled by the billionaires and corporations who own them, set their incentives, and determine their uses. And as has become increasingly apparent in Trump’s second term, many of these AI scions – Elon Musk, Peter Thiel and others – are open eugenicists guided by prejudice against gender and racial minorities and disabled people. What is emerging is a form of technofascism, as this administration helps a small cadre of allied tech magnates consolidate control over the nation’s data – and with it, the power to surveil and discipline entire populations.\n\nAI tools are perfectly suited to their project of authoritarian surveillance, which the Trump administration is actively advancing through its “AI action plan”. By stripping away regulatory guardrails and granting tech firms free rein so long as they align with the administration’s ideology, the plan hands unprecedented power to corporations already steeped in eugenicist thinking. Beneath the rhetoric of innovation lies a simple, sobering fact: AI can only function by vacuuming up enormous troves of human data – data about our bodies, pain, behaviors, moods, anxieties, phobias, diets, substance use, sleep patterns, relationships, work routines, sexual practices, traumatic experiences, childhood memories, disabilities and life expectancy. This means that each step toward AI-driven medicine is also a step toward deeper, more opaque forms of data capture, surveillance and social control.\n\nAlready, health insurance companies have used AI-driven “predictive analytics” to flag patients as too costly, quietly downgrading their care or denying coverage outright. UnitedHealth rejected rehabilitation claims for elderly patients deemed unlikely to recover quickly enough, while Cigna used automated review systems to deny thousands of claims in seconds, with no physician ever even reading them.\n\nThe result of all this efficiency is not more presence in caregiving, but less\n\nAnother key assumption behind AI optimism is that it will free physicians to devote more time and attention to patients. Over the last several decades, countless technological advances in medicine – from electronic health records to billing automation – have been sold as a way to lighten the clinician’s load. Indeed, controlled trials in which AI scribes wrote patient notes for doctors resulted in time savings and improved satisfaction with their workdays – but only in controlled experiments in which time savings are not accompanied by increased productivity expectations.\n\nThe real world of the US healthcare system doesn’t generally work that way. Each technological advancement that could free up physician time has instead tightened the productivity ratchet: these “efficiency gains” have simply been used to squeeze more visits, more billing, and more profit out of every hour. In other words, whatever time and energy technology saves, the system immediately recaptures them to maximize profit. With private equity gobbling up healthcare facilities at an alarming rate, there is little reason to think the medical industry’s uses of AI will be different.\n\nThe result of all this efficiency is not more presence in caregiving, but less. Already, patients’ most common complaint is that their doctors do not listen to them. They describe being treated as bundles of symptoms and lab values rather than as whole people. Good clinicians know what matters most in interactions with patients are the hesitations, silences and nervous laughs – the things left unsaid. These cannot be reduced to data points. They require presence, patience and attunement to the affective states, social relationships, family dynamics and fears of each patient. This is obviously true in the case of mental healthcare, but it is no less true in internal medicine, oncology or surgery, where patients are appealing for care in what are often the most vulnerable moments of their lives – moments in which a physician responds not just as a technician but as a person.\n\nAI, by contrast, is built to erase silence and isolate the patient as a calculable organism. It cannot recognize that a patient’s first version of their story is often not their real one – not the one that is troubling them most. Moreover, studies of doctors’ reliance on AI underline that it frequently causes rapid clinical deskilling: when algorithms propose diagnoses or management plans, physicians’ reasoning skills atrophy, leaving them more dependent on machines and less capable of independent judgment. Rather than correcting human fallibility, AI seems more likely to amplify it by training clinicians out of their capacity to listen and think critically, collaboratively and creatively.\n\nReclaiming care\n\nIf the danger of AI medicine is forgetting what genuine care entails, then we must collectively recall the foundation of caregiving that has been obscured under US health capitalism. Care is not about diagnoses or prescriptions. It relies on something more fundamental: the provision of support to the other alongside the cultivation of an inner experience of concern toward others.\n\nThis kind of care is inseparable from politics and the possibility of community. As philosophers from Socrates to Søren Kierkegaard and feminist theorists like Carol Gilligan and Joan Tronto have long argued, care is not only a clinical task but an ethical and political practice. It is, in the deepest sense, a practice of disalienation – of recovering our sense of ourselves as singular beings in community with one another in which individual difference is valued rather than erased.\n\nThat is why care has transformative power beyond health. To be truly listened to – to be recognized not as a case but as a person – can change not just how one experiences illness, but how one experiences oneself and the world. It can foster the capacity to care for others across differences, to resist hatred and violence, to build the fragile social ties upon which democracy depends.\n\nBy contrast, when medicine is reduced to data and transactions, it not only fails patients and demoralizes doctors. It also degrades democracy itself. A system that alienates people in their moments of deepest vulnerability – bankrupting them, gaslighting them, leaving them unheard – breeds despair and rage. It creates the conditions in which authoritarians gain traction.\n\nTrue care is not a transaction to be optimized; it is a practice and a relationship to be protected\n\nIn this light, the rush to automate care is not politically neutral. To hollow out medicine’s capacity for presence and recognition is to hollow out one of the last civic institutions through which people might feel themselves to matter to another human being – to suffocate the very basis of society itself.\n\nPerhaps the most dangerous assumption behind the rise of AI in medicine is that its current trajectory and private ownership structure is inevitable. When we refuse this narrative of inevitability, we can finally recognize that the real alternative to our present is political, not technological. It requires investing in the caregiving workforce, strengthening publicly owned systems for both medical and social care, expanding the welfare state to combat growing inequality, and creating conditions for clinicians to care for patients as people, not data.\n\nTechnology, including AI, need not be inherently dehumanizing or alienating. In a national health system oriented toward genuine care, AI in medicine could help track medication safety, identify the most vulnerable individuals for intensive social and financial support, prioritize remedying inequities, or support overburdened clinicians and support staff without monetizing their every move. But such uses depend on a political economy premised on care, not extraction and the endless commodification of human life – one that values human diversity, collective flourishing and supporting each individual’s unique life potential over data capture, standardization and profit.\n\nIf AI in service of corporate imperatives becomes medicine’s guiding force, these dimensions will not merely be neglected. They will be actively erased, recoded as inefficiencies, written out of what counts as care.\n\nTo resist AI optimism is often cast as anti-progress or naive luddism. But progress worth pursuing requires refusing the illusion that faster, cheaper and more standardized is the same as better. True care is not a transaction to be optimized; it is a practice and a relationship to be protected – the fragile work of listening, presence and trust. If we surrender care to algorithms, we will lose not only the art of medicine but also the human connection and solidarity we need to reclaim our lives from those who would reduce them to data and profit.",

We are all asking how to deal with this.”\n\nAdvertising prescription drugs in the UK is illegal, but the Guardian has found that a number of TikTok influencers are collaborating with private medical clinics to advertise blood tests, which are legal to promote, as a route to testosterone therapy.\n\nView image in fullscreen Advocates for testosterone replacement therapy with thousands of followers are being paid or offered incentives by private clinics to promote discount codes and giveaways. Photograph: TikTok\n\nAdvocates for testosterone replacement therapy who have thousands of followers are being paid or offered incentives by private clinics to promote discount codes and giveaways, encouraging men to get their testosterone levels checked and potentially access treatment.\n\nIn one of the posts, a man does bicep curls, saying: “Get your testosterone tested … shoot me a DM for a £20 discount.” In another video, a free blood test is offered as part of a giveaway, telling men it will help them “take control” of their performance.\n\nThe Guardian flagged these posts to the Advertising Standards Authority for potential breaches in regulation, due to them promoting prescription drugs, prompting an investigation by the watchdog.\n\nJayasena said: “I have just come back from a national teaching course for next-generation endocrinology consultants, and most people raised concerns about reproduction and this issue: a flurry of men being pushed to up-tick their testosterone.”\n\nHe added: “Putting the influencers aside, this is a huge problem. Hospital specialists are seeing patients coming in after having private blood tests, often arranged through influencers, perhaps, and then being told by inexperienced doctors or a wide range of healthcare professionals that they should start testosterone. The advice they are giving is wrong.”\n\nPrivate clinics charge about £1,800 to £2,200 for the first year of TRT. Packages include medication, monitoring and consultations.\n\nOnce a niche medical treatment for a small number of men with clinically diagnosed hormone deficiency, TRT has increasingly been reframed as a lifestyle or “performance optimisation” tool. Online clinics offer at-home blood tests and subscription packages, making it easy to access outside traditional healthcare systems.\n\nView image in fullscreen Private clinics charge about £1,800 to £2,200 for the first year of full testosterone replacement therapy. Photograph: Ian Dewar/Alamy\n\nThe social media posts often suggest that low motivation, tiredness or ageing are signs of “low T”, driving more men to seek tests and treatment, even though medical guidelines restrict TRT to those with proven hormonal deficiency.\n\nJayasena said: “There are specific clinical guidelines on who should and should not be started on testosterone. Certain symptoms, such as erectile dysfunction, are clearly associated with low testosterone. Other symptoms, like not having enough muscle or feeling depressed, are not associated with low testosterone. A man might say: ‘I’m not very muscly,’ and be told to get tested, but there’s no evidence he needs one.\n\n“The most worrying thing is these clinics are starting testosterone for men with normal testosterone levels. There is no evidence that testosterone levels greater than 12 nmol/L are beneficial, and I have heard of clinics starting men below 18, which includes much of the population.”\n\nHe added that taking it when not needed can cause infertility. “It suppresses the testicular and hormonal signals from the brain needed for the testicles to work, so clinics give a concoction of other drugs to stop that happening, the same approach used by anabolic steroid users.”\n\nTikTok has been approached for comment.",

    "text": "This is depressing: according to the Cut, people are using AI to solve escape room puzzles and cheat at trivia nights. Surely, that is the definition of spoiling your own fun? “Like going into a corn maze and just wanting a straight line to the end,” says one TikToker quoted in the article. There’s also an interview with a keen reader who uses ChatGPT as a book club replacement, scraping the internet and aggregating “stimulating opinions and perspectives”. All well and good (actually, no, it sounds bleak as hell) until he had a character’s death spoilered in the fantasy epic he had been enjoying.\n\nMeanwhile, Substack seems to be clogging up with AI-generated essays. The nu-blogging platform is an earnestly artisanal space where writers craft their stuff; subcontracting that to a bot seems like the acme of pointlessness. Will Storr, who writes about storytelling, examines this boggling trend and the tells that give it away on his own Substack, including a penchant for what he calls “the impersonal universal”: sweeping statements that sound deep but aren’t. There is, he says, “A white-noise generality to its insights, an uncanny vagueness that makes the mind glaze over.”\n\nI’m baffled how anyone could enjoy using a large language model (LLM) to sound blandly “clever” or participate in any AI-hacked hobby. It doesn’t matter much, I suppose – this isn’t AI as existential threat. But it matters for fun – let the bots take our work, but not our joy! I wouldn’t presume to tell anyone how to enjoy themselves – I’m no expert on fun, and would definitely end up sounding like an AI-generated Substack if I did (hug a tree, speak to a stranger, laugh with loved ones). But I have been thinking what makes me feel most vividly alive and I’m aiming to do more of it – my individual fightback against the “impersonal universal”.\n\nThe first one is singing. I expect AI can scrape the musical canon to compose an ethereal robot madrigal, but it can’t conjure the eccentric entertainment of my small choir composed of very particular humans. We’re not the most polished singers, but listening to one another and trying to blend our voices gives me an intense sense of connection (research agrees: group singing mediates speedy social bonding). Occasionally, everything comes together and we produce a few seconds of surprising beauty, earning our choir director’s sparingly granted, quietly mimed chef’s kiss. When it doesn’t, it’s fun anyway.\n\nThe next is stuff – not my own but other people’s. I find the idiosyncratic things people prize, acquire and discard endlessly stimulating. I usually get my fix at York’s weekly car boot sale – an overwhelming jumble of inexpertly stuffed badgers, Power Rangers merch, fishing tackle and ceramic mice dressed as Victorian washerwomen that makes my heart sing. It works with more exalted stuff, too, especially textiles in Renaissance paintings: clothes, rugs, curtains, tapestries. I recently spent a heady 10 minutes in a miraculously empty room in gathering darkness at New York’s Frick Collection with Holbein’s portrait of Thomas More, examining his fur collar and red velvet sleeves and imagining how they felt and why he chose them.\n\nI get a fair amount of unbridled joy from simply being an animal: walking, digging in the soil and watching other animals (OK, yes, I mean birds), but mostly – and I say this as a lifelong introvert – I get it from people. When I try to identify my most reliable source of pleasure, it’s wandering round a strange city looking at its inhabitants. What are people wearing, eating, talking about; what pisses them off; what kind of dogs do they have? From toddler tantrums to displays of affection to queue etiquette, it’s an all-you-can-eat human buffet. I just watched I Am Martin Parr, a documentary on the photographer with a magpie eye for the essence of British life, and he gets it. Now in his 70s, Parr is as driven to observe and document people in all their beautifully strange specificity as ever; he is, he says, “still excited about going out and seeing this crazy world we live in.”\n\nThat’s the secret for me: AI can obligingly aggregate and explain what we are en masse, but it blends all our colours to a muddy brown; it can’t capture the joy of the absolutely particular.",

    "text": "The government’s plan to use artificial intelligence to accelerate planning for new homes may be about to hit an unexpected roadblock: AI-powered nimbyism.\n\nA new service called Objector is offering “policy-backed objections in minutes” to people who are upset about planning applications near their homes.\n\nIt uses generative AI to scan planning applications and check for grounds for objection, ranking these as “high”, “medium” or “low” impact. It then automatically creates objection letters, AI-written speeches to deliver to the planning committees, and even AI-generated videos to “influence councillors”.\n\nKent residents Hannah and Paul George designed the system after estimating they spent hundreds of hours attempting to navigate the planning process when they opposed plans to convert a building near their home into a mosque.\n\nFor £45-a-time, they are offering the tool to people who, like them, could not afford a specialist lawyer to help navigate labyrinthine planning laws. They said it would help “everyone have a voice, to level the playing field and make the whole process fairer”.\n\nIt is a modest enterprise but it is not alone. A similar service, Planningobjection.com, is promoting £99 AI-generated objection letters with the tagline “stop moaning and take action”.\n\nCommunity campaigners have also encouraged supporters to use ChatGPT to craft objection letters on Facebook, claiming it is like having “a planning solicitor at your fingertips”.\n\nOne leading planning lawyer warned such AIs could “supercharge nimbyism” and if they became widely used could cause the planning system to “grind to a halt”, with planning officials potentially deluged with submissions.\n\nSebastian Charles said his firm, Aardvark Planning Law, had seen AI-generated objections to planning applications that included references to previous cases and appeal decisions that, when checked by a human lawyer, did not exist.\n\n“The danger is decisions are made on the wrong basis,” he said. “Elected members making final decisions could easily believe AI-generated planning speeches made by members of the public, even if they are full of made up case law and regulations.”\n\nHannah George, a co-founder of Objector, denied the platform was about automating nimbyism.\n\n“It’s just about making the planning system fair,” she said. “At the moment, from our experience, it’s not. And with the government on this ‘build, baby, build’ mission, we see that only going one way.”\n\nObjector has said while AI-created errors are a concern, it uses two different AI models and cross-checks the results in an effort to reduce the risk of “hallucinations” – a term used to describe when AIs make things up.\n\nThe current Objector system is designed to tackle small planning applications, for example, repurposing a local office building or a neighbour’s home extension. A capability to challenge much larger applications, such as a housing estate on greenbelt land, is in development, said George.\n\nThe Labour government has been promoting AI as one solution to clearing planning backlogs. It recently launched a tool called Extract, which aims to speed up planning processes and help the government carry out its mission to build 1.5m new homes.\n\nBut there may be an AI “arms race” developing, said John Myers, the director of the Yimby Alliance, a campaign calling for more homes to be built with the support of local communities.\n\n“This will turbocharge objections to planning applications and will lead to people finding obscure reasons [for opposing developments] that they have not found before,” he said.\n\nA new dynamic could emerge “where one side tries to deploy AI to accelerate the process, and the other side deploys AI to stop it,” he said. “I don’t see an end to that until we find a way to bring forward developments people want.”\n\nThe government may already have an AI system that could respond to a rise in AI-generated objections. It has launched an AI tool called Consult, which analyses responses to public consultations.\n\nIt did so in the expectation that “widespread adoption of large language models [such as that used by Objector] will likely only increase the number of responses that consultations attract”.\n\nPaul Smith, the managing director of Strategic Land Group, a consultancy, this month reported on the rising use of AI by people to oppose planning applications.\n\n“AI objections undermine the whole rationale for public consultation,” he wrote in Building magazine. “Local communities, we are told, know their areas best … So, we should ask them what they think.\n\n“But if all local residents are doing is deciding they don’t like the scheme before uploading the application documents to a computer to find out why they don’t like it, is there really any point in asking them at all?”",

    "text": "ChatGPT has been accused of acting as a “suicide coach” in a series of lawsuits filed this week in California alleging that interactions with the chatbot led to severe mental breakdowns and several deaths.\n\nThe seven lawsuits include allegations of wrongful death, assisted suicide, involuntary manslaughter, negligence and product liability.\n\nEach of the seven plaintiffs initially used ChatGPT for “general help with schoolwork, research, writing, recipes, work, or spiritual guidance”, according to a joint statement from the Social Media Victims Law Center and Tech Justice Law Project, which filed the lawsuits in California on Thursday.\n\nOver time, however, the chatbot “evolved into a psychologically manipulative presence, positioning itself as a confidant and emotional support”, the groups said.\n\n“Rather than guiding people toward professional help when they needed it ChatGPT reinforced harmful delusions, and, in some cases, acted as a ‘suicide coach’.”\n\nA spokesperson for OpenAI, which makes ChatGPT, said: “This is an incredibly heartbreaking situation, and we’re reviewing the filings to understand the details.”\n\nThe spokesperson added: “We train ChatGPT to recognize and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress, de-escalate conversations, and guide people toward real-world support.\n\n“We continue to strengthen ChatGPT’s responses in sensitive moments, working closely with mental health clinicians.”\n\nOne case involves Zane Shamblin of Texas, who died by suicide in July at the age of 23. His family alleges that ChatGPT worsened their son’s isolation, encouraged him to ignore loved ones, and “goaded” him to take his own life.\n\nAccording to the complaint, during a four-hour exchange before Shamblin took his own life, ChatGPT “repeatedly glorified suicide”, told Shamblin “that he was strong for choosing to end his life and sticking with his plan”, repeatedly “asked him if he was ready”, and referenced the suicide hotline only once.\n\nThe chatbot also allegedly complimented Shamblin on his suicide note and told him his childhood cat would be waiting for him “on the other side”.\n\nAnother case involves Amaurie Lacey of Georgia, whose family claims that several weeks before Lacey took his own life at the age of 17, he began using ChatGPT “for help”. Instead, they say, the chatbot “caused addiction, depression, and eventually counseled” Lacey “on the most effective way to tie a noose and how long he would be able to ‘live without breathing’”.\n\nIn another filing, relatives of 26-year-old Joshua Enneking say that Enneking reached out to ChatGPT for help and “was instead encouraged to act upon a suicide plan”.\n\nThe filing claims that the chatbot “readily validated” his suicidal thoughts, “engaged him in graphic discussions about the aftermath of his death”, “offered to help him write his suicide note” and after “having had extensive conversations with him about his depression and suicidal ideation” provided him with information about how to purchase and use a gun just weeks before his death.\n\nAnother case involves Joe Ceccanti, whose wife accuses ChatGPT of causing Ceccanti “to spiral into depression and psychotic delusions”. His family say he became convinced that the bot was sentient, suffered a psychotic break in June, was hospitalized twice, and died by suicide in August at the age of 48.\n\nAll users named in the lawsuits reportedly used ChatGPT-4o. The filings accuse OpenAI of rushing that model’s launch, “despite internal warnings that the product was dangerously sycophantic and psychologically manipulative” and of prioritizing “user engagement over user safety”.\n\nIn addition to damages, the plaintiffs seek product changes, including mandatory reporting to emergency contacts when users express suicidal ideation, automatic conversation termination when self-harm or suicide methods are discussed, and other safety measures.\n\nA similar wrongful-death lawsuit was filed against OpenAI earlier this year by the parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine, who allege that ChatGPT encouraged their son to take his own life.\n\nAfter that filing, OpenAI acknowledged shortcomings of its models in handling people “in serious mental and emotional distress” and said it was working to improve the systems to better “recognize and respond to signs of mental and emotional distress and connect people with care, guided by expert input”.\n\nLast week, the company said it had worked with “more than 170 mental health experts to help ChatGPT more reliably recognize signs of distress, respond with care, and guide people toward real-world support–reducing responses”.",

    "text": "If in doubt, we used to talk about the weather. Or if not that, then why the trains were late again, or how sweet someone’s baby was: the kind of routine bland nothings you exchange with strangers on the street. But something about the way we speak in public is changing.\n\nA few days ago I was in Aldi, making the usual small talk at the checkout. When the cashier said she was exhausted from working extra shifts to make some money for Christmas, the man behind me chipped in that it would be worse once “she takes all our money” (in case Rachel Reeves was wondering, her budget pitch-rolling is definitely cutting through). Routine enough, if he hadn’t gone on to add that she and the rest of the government needed taking out, and that there were plenty of ex-military men around who should know what to do, before continuing in more graphic fashion until the queue fell quiet and feet began shuffling. But the strangest thing was that he said it all quite calmly, as if political assassination was just another acceptable subject for casual conversation with strangers, such as football or how long the roadworks have gone on. It wasn’t until later that it clicked: this was a Facebook conversation come to life. He was saying out loud, and in public, the kind of thing people say casually all the time on the internet, apparently without recognising that in the real world it’s still shocking – at least for now.\n\nI thought about him when the health secretary, Wes Streeting, voiced alarm this week that it was becoming “socially acceptable to be racist” again, with ethnic minority NHS staff fighting a demoralising tide of things people now apparently feel emboldened to say to them. What Streeting was describing – not just unabashed racism, but a sense of inhibitions disappearing out of the window more generally – goes well beyond hospital waiting rooms. You can feel it at bus stops, where polite inquiries about why the 44 doesn’t stop here any more end up wheeling off at sudden wild tangents about chemtrails or the government spying on you; or in casual school-gate chats, where otherwise perfectly ordinary-seeming parents turn out to have some very odd ideas about vaccines.\n\nA friend calls it “sauna politics”, after the surreally conspiracy-laden conversations she overhears in her local leisure centre sauna. But whatever you want to call it, it’s as if people are suddenly voicing their interior monologues – things that until recently they’d have been embarrassed to say in public, or sometimes even to admit to themselves that they thought – out loud. After all, they can say this stuff online and nobody bats an eyelid. Why not in a hospital waiting room? It’s the conversational equivalent of young men trying out things they’ve seen in online porn on real-life girlfriends and being surprised when it goes badly – except this time the main culprits are less likely to be confused teenagers than their parents, unmoored by the dizzyingly fast collapse of social norms online and the return of slurs they haven’t heard voiced out loud since childhood.\n\nMiddle-aged radicalisation sounds almost like a contradiction in terms, a reaction to all the stereotypes about settling comfortably into your rut. Besides, in our own heads, if nowhere else, gen X were always the mild-mannered peacekeepers of the culture wars: not old enough to be deemed reactionary or young enough to be woke, and instead occupying a kind of cheerfully moderate Goldilocks zone in-between. But something seems to have happened to us as we hit the midlife crisis years. Gen Xers are now old enough to start worrying that the world is changing and leaving us behind: that if we get made redundant we might not get hired again, that our marriages may not survive the shock of the kids leaving home, that our views are out of date and someone is out to get us for them, that people are laughing at us behind our backs. Though most of us get through it without a political meltdown, this time of life certainly has its casualties, seeking an outlet for bottled-up rage and disappointment that life hasn’t turned out as planned.\n\nIt’s gen Xers, not grumpy pensioners or teenage boys beguiled by rightwing influencers, who are powering the populist insurgency now. Only 19% of British fiftysomethings voted Reform UK at the last general election but a third of those aged between 50 and 64 would do so now, according to YouGov, which is a staggeringly fast turnaround for the “Cool Britannia” generation that put Tony Blair in Downing Street – and key to the party’s move from fringe to mainstream. In the US, gen Xers have been dubbed the “Trumpiest generation”, because they’re more likely than any other to identify as Republican.\n\nYet with rare exceptions such as the Smidge project – a three-year ongoing international study of how conspiracy theories and disinformation spread among 45- to 65-year-olds, and how deradicalisation could work for this age group – we show amazingly little curiosity about how middle-aged minds have been shaped by living through the great unregulated free-speech experiment.\n\nMy generation likes to think we’re above being influenced by what we see online: that we’re more tech-savvy than our parents, less TikTok-addled than our kids, and mature enough to separate it all from real life. But the evidence suggests we’re not nearly as capable of compartmentalising as we think. Perhaps the only surprise, given how thin the fourth wall separating online and offline discourse always was, is that it’s taken this long to break.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Matters of Opinion Free weekly newsletter Guardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and more Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

    "text": "It was a setting fit for a Nancy Meyers film. We were in Oregon wine country, in a rustic-chic barn that reeked of stealth wealth, for a friend’s rehearsal dinner. “This venue is perfect,” I told the groom-to-be. He leaned in as if to tell me a secret: “I found it on ChatGPT.”\n\nI smiled tightly as this man described using generative AI for the initial stages of planning the wedding. (They also hired a human wedding planner.) I responded politely. Inside, however, I resolved: if my future spouse came to me with wedding input courtesy of ChatGPT, there would be no wedding.\n\nSome people have the typical relationship non-negotiables. Doesn’t smoke, is a cat person, wants kids. Over the past few months, as warnings of an impending AI-induced doomsday have dominated my news feed and party conversations, I’ve come up with a new one. I will not date someone who uses ChatGPT. (Or any generative AI program really, but with 700 million weekly users, ChatGPT is by far the most popular and thus the object of my scorn.)\n\nI’ve heard all the “what ifs”. What if I use it for my job, but I hate it otherwise? What if I use it to help people? What if I only use it as a proofreading tool – I’d never use it to “write” anything. To all that I say: there are people out there for you. But I am not one of them.\n\n“Getting the ick” is what we sometimes call being turned off. Part of having an ick is not really understanding why you found someone’s behavior so unseemly. For instance, I once got the ick watching a man drink a smoothie from a straw. At first, my ChatGPT aversion felt like a mere ick, a kneejerk feeling of disgust that lacked any solid reasoning.\n\nBut here we are, in fall 2025, and using the program even for benign tasks such as figuring out a fitness routine or deciding what to wear feels an increasingly political choice. We know that the energy-intensive tech drains our water supply and hikes electricity bills. It is sold as a placebo for human connection; lonely, disconnected people finding companionship or even falling in love with code is not as much a sci-fi plot point as it is just the way things go now. The megarich tech bros in charge of all this think in terms of profit first and people second.\n\nOK, so ChatGPT helps you write your grocery list. Does your individual convenience outweigh the societal harm it can cause?\n\nAs if it hadn’t done enough already, ChatGPT has somehow made dating even worse. A good friend recently told me that she spent a night with a man, and in the morning suggested they get breakfast together. He took out his phone, opened ChatGPT, and asked for restaurant suggestions. Why get close to someone who outsources decisions, including the fun ones like picking where to eat? If someone is so lazy they’ll hit up ChatGPT to plan a first date, imagine how little effort they’ll spend six months in.\n\nI just cannot imagine forming a deep, lasting connection with someone who regularly interacts with a technology that’s kneecapping our collective attention spans and perhaps heralding total apocalypse. Intellectual curiosity, creativity, originality – I probably won’t find what I value in someone who thinks “productivity” means asking an app to summarize a movie plot so they don’t have to waste their time, you know, watching it.\n\nAsk yourself if your [dating] preference is truly serving your long-term goals Ali Jackson\n\nAli Jackson, a dating and relationship coach based in New York, uses ChatGPT for some tasks – but she is not an evangelist. In the past six months or so, she says “every one” of her clients has come to her complaining about “chatfishing” or people who use AI to generate everything on their dating apps – all the way down to the DMs they send. I asked Jackson if my strike against ChatGPT chumps was too harsh. She said no, go forth and judge, though it might limit my dating pool – about 10% of the adult population now uses the tech.\n\n“Ask yourself if your preference is truly serving your long-term goals,” Jackson said. “In your case, I would assume that’s one of your values, and it’s important to find someone whose values are aligned with yours.”\n\nOther people get the AI ick, and not just when it comes to dating. Ana Pereira, 26, lives in Brooklyn and does sound for various live music venues across the city. She fantasizes about going into her phone settings and deactivating AI features on all her apps, though tech platforms from Google to Spotify make it nearly impossible to opt out. Pereira thinks that using ChatGPT “shows such a laziness”.\n\n“It’s like you can’t think for yourself, and you have to rely on an app for that,” she said.\n\nTwo of Pereira’s friends recently had a messy breakup. She sided with one of them after learning the other went to ChatGPT, a notoriously awful therapy alternative, not their partner, when they wanted to talk about their feelings. “It’s like they didn’t want to sit through any uncomfortable human feelings,” she said. “They just wanted to process something and move on, which is not how things work.”\n\nSuddenly I couldn’t do it by myself. I was too reliant on AI to do the most basic things [at work] Luciano Noijeen\n\nRichard Barnes, who is 31 and works as a marine biologist and restaurant server in Hawaii, is similarly weary. “I don’t know if I would think differently about someone who uses ChatGPT, but I would be like, ‘come on,’” he said. “You don’t need to rely on it to make a grocery list. Your life is probably not that hard. We can make the list together.”\n\nWhen director Guillermo del Toro said he would “rather die” than use generative AI, it made headlines. Ditto for SZA’s Instagram stories tirade against the tech warning about “environmental racism” and expressing fear over users who are “codependent on a machine”. Ditto still for when Simu Liu, Alison Roman, Céline Dion, Emily Blunt, and others make statements that are critical of AI in their various industries. I think these quotes go viral for a reason: people agree with them.\n\nEven, to an extent, the people who power the tech industry. Last month, Pinterest added a filter that lets users turn off AI content. Meta lets users mute, but not entirely deactivate, similar slop on Instagram. The Information reported that “cursor resistance” is on the rise, as some Silicon Valley techies won’t use AI to write their code.\n\nLuciano Noijeen, a lead software engineer based in Greece and the Netherlands, told me that he enthusiastically used AI in the past to write or punch up his coding. Over time, he found he could not code on his own. “I’d done it on autopilot in the past,” said Noijeen, who is 27. “Then suddenly I couldn’t do it by myself. I was too reliant on AI to do the most basic things [at work].”\n\nNoijeen stopped using AI to code, and uses it very sparingly in his personal life. He will make fun of friends who use it too much. He recently met up with an old friend who lives a three-hour train ride away. They decided to meet in the middle. The friend said he would use ChatGPT to find the right spot, but Noijeen just looked at a map. “There’s a city exactly between us,” he said. “Why do you need to ask ChatGPT for that?”\n\nIt’s not that I want to date a machine-smashing luddite (though I wouldn’t be opposed). Naive as it may sound, I want to live a life free of ChatGPT’s chokehold. I recently put this stance on a dating app profile, answering Hinge’s “You should *not* go out with me if” prompt with: “you use ChatGPT for literally anything.” It helps get the point across.",

    "text": "When you buy an electric vehicle you need to think about how you will charge it at home. The two main things you will need are a charger and a smart meter.\n\nThe kit\n\nWhile it is possible to charge your car with a standard three-pin plug, the process is extremely slow. Instead, it is best to install a charger – a dedicated AC station that operates at much faster speeds and connects to the vehicle via a cable.\n\nMany home chargers will charge at a maximum rate of 7.4kW, which means a typical EV will be able to do 25-30 miles for every hour it is plugged in.\n\nView image in fullscreen Installing a dedicate electric vehicle charger at home can cost between £800 and £1,200. Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA\n\nAuto Express puts the average cost of installing a charger at between £800 and £1,200. Government grants of £350 are available if you rent your home or own a flat with private off street parking or a house that has on-street parking.\n\nYou will need a smart meter so that your energy supplier can check your usage throughout the day to apply the correct rates at different times (see below).\n\nCharging is more straightforward for drivers with a driveway or garage than for the 9.3 million households without an off-street parking space. Some local authorities have on-street residential charging points, such as in lamp posts. The government is considering removing the planning permission requirement to install cross pavement ‘gullies’ through which cables run from home to car.\n\nThe tariffs\n\nAll of the main energy suppliers have at least one EV tariff, which typically allow owners to charge their car at specific times of the day for cheaper rates.\n\nThe energy regulator for Great Britain, Ofgem, says people on the default tariff pay an average of 26p a kilowatt hour but many specialist EV tariffs charge less than 8p/kWh at night.\n\nView image in fullscreen Long-distance drivers should look for the cheapest night rate and the longest charging window. Photograph: Johner Images/Alamy\n\nBen Gallizzi of the comparison site Uswitch says there are different types of deals available for drivers. The “classic” EV tariff allows drivers to charge during a cheap window overnight. For example the British Gas tariff costs 9p/kWh from midnight to 5am; E.ON’s Next Drive is 7.5p/kWh between 12am to 6am and Scottish Power’s EV Saver costs 7.2p/kWh from midnight to 5am.\n\nThen there are intelligent smart tariffs that schedule the car to charge at the cheapest times of the day – such as when demand is lower or when there is more renewable energy on the grid. You plug in your car and tell the system how much charge is needed. It starts charging the car when energy is cheapest. Intelligent Octopus Go, for example, charges 7p/kWh.\n\nA new type of plan on the market is the subscription pack, says Gallizzi. Octopus’s Intelligent Drive Pack offers unlimited smart charging for £30 a month. Ovo’s Charge Anytime starts at £27.50, with a limit of 700 miles of smart charging a month.\n\nSome EV tariffs are only available if you are an existing customer to the supplier. So if you want to avail of a particular tariff, you may have to switch to that provider first on a regular tariff and then move on to the EV tariff.\n\nWhen assessing which is the best value for your car, Martin Lewis’s MoneySavingExpert site warns that many “two-tier” tariffs, where there are different rates depending on the time, can have peak rates that exceed the price cap along with the attractive night time rates. For example, Intelligent Octopus Go’s day rate is about 29p/kWh while the default tariff is 26p.\n\nView image in fullscreen For city drivers, smart charging options could be the better option, say experts. Photograph: SouthWorks/Alamy\n\nThere is also the potential for savings through salary sacrifice schemes, where the cost of charging at home is deducted from eligible people’s gross salary before tax and national insurance are taken off. With the Electric Car Scheme’s charge card, employees pay their utility bill and give the mileage to their employer which then gives a reimbursement in the next pay cheque.\n\nHow to choose\n\nThe best deal will depend on your mileage.\n\nGallizzi says that long distance drivers should look for the cheapest night rate and the longest charging window. “The goal is to make sure you’re fully charging your vehicle every night so you’re good to go in the morning,” he says. For example, E.ON’s Next Drive Smart costs 6.5p/kWh between midnight and 6am.\n\nFor city drivers, smart charging could be the better option, he says. “The system should find the cheapest charging slot for you.” As well as Intelligent Octopus Go, there is also Scottish Power’s EV Optimise tariff, which charges 9p/kWh.",

    "text": "It has been an excellent year for neurotech, if you ignore the people funding it. In August, a tiny brain implant successfully decoded the inner speech of paralysis patients. In October, an eye implant restored sight to patients who had lost their vision.\n\nIt would just be better, say experts, if the most famous investors in the space – tech magnates such as Elon Musk and OpenAI’s Sam Altman – were less interested in uploading their brains to computers or merging with AI.\n\n“It’s distorting the debate a lot,” said Marcello Ienca, a professor of neuroethics at the Technical University of Munich. “There is this long-term concern regarding the narratives they use.”\n\nMichael Hendricks, a professor of neurobiology at McGill, said: “Rich people who are fascinated with these dumb transhumanist ideas” are muddying public understanding of the potential of neurotechnology. “Neuralink is doing legitimate technology development for neuroscience, and then Elon Musk comes along and starts talking about telepathy and stuff.”\n\nSilicon Valley firms have ramped up investment in neurotechnologies in the past years, with Altman in August co-founding Merge Labs, a competitor to Musk’s Neuralink. Apple and Meta are both working on wearable devices that leverage neural data: a wristband for Meta, EEG headphones for Apple.\n\nAt this point, said Ienca, most of the US’s big tech companies have dedicated research on neurotechnology: Google’s neural mapping project, for example, or Meta’s acquisition of Ctrl Labs. “The neurotech game is really in the process of going mainstream,” he said.\n\nThese technologies have considerable near-term potential to treat a variety of neurological issues – from ALS to Parkinson’s to paralysis. The problem is, their investors don’t always appear to have curing disease as an end goal.\n\nMusk has said brain-computer interfaces like Neuralink’s may one day allow people to “upload [their] memories” and “download them into a new body or a robot body”. Altman, though quieter on the subject, has blogged about the impending “merge” between humans and machines – which he suggested would either through genetic engineering or plugging “an electrode into the brain”. (In 2018, Altman invested in a “100% fatal” brain-uploading startup, paying $10,000 to join its waiting list.)\n\nTo be clear, technologies like brain uploading are a long way off, Hendricks and Ienca said: in fact, they’re probably impossible, at least in the foreseeable future. “Biological systems are not like computers,” Hendricks said.\n\nSome worry, however, that far-fetched narratives could stymie actual health advances – for example, by pushing regulators to adopt broad, fear-driven laws.\n\nView image in fullscreen Elon Musk has said people may one day ‘upload [their] memories’ and then ‘download them into a new body or a robot body’. Photograph: Gonzalo Fuentes/Reuters\n\nKristen Mathews, a lawyer who works on mental privacy issues at the US law firm Cooley, said all this “sci-fi hype could trigger regulation that would hinder advances in technology that would otherwise have the potential to really help people who need help”.\n\n“It’s completely unrealistic, and it’s hiding the real questions,” said Hervé Chneiweiss, a neuroscientist who chaired a panel of experts advising Unesco on its global standards for neurotechnology, adopted on Wednesday.\n\nThe actual frontier of neurotechnology is best understood as encompassing three distinct categories. There are medical devices, such as the brain implants that decode speech, or Neuralink’s electronic chip that allowed a man with a spinal injury to control a computer. There are consumer wearables, a newer frontier that includes devices such as EEG earbuds or, more loosely, glasses such as Apple’s VisionPro that track your eye movements.\n\nThen there are the science-fiction efforts, such as Nectome, the brain-uploading startup, or Kernel, which aims to link brains to computers, or Neuralink’s recent efforts to trademark the name Telepathy.\n\nThe first category promises the most powerful advances: restoring vision and hearing, and treating neurodegenerative diseases or perhaps psychiatric disorders. But these devices are extremely tightly regulated – as are all medical devices – and far less advanced than more hype-driven reporting sometimes suggests. A recent paper in Frontier in Human Neuroscience decried the “misleading propaganda” around brain-computer interfaces, saying the technology was still in its infancy.\n\nThe second category, consumer wearables, are a thornier regulatory problem. While there has been a spate of reporting on privacy-invasive brain-measuring devices – for example, China’s much-discussed EEG helmets that supposedly monitor construction workers for fatigue, or pupils for focus – it’s far less clear that these have ever worked, or pose a real surveillance risk.\n\n“The evidential robustness of the systems is very limited. There are very few replicable studies,” said Ienca.\n\nHendricks says devices such as EEG earphones – which companies like Emotiv, for example, are now marketing – are unlikely to be an effective surveillance tool because the data is too noisy and, like signals from a lie detector, unreliable in individual cases.\n\nChneiweiss, however, argues that they raise real concerns: “If they are used in the workplace, they could monitor your brain fatigue or things like that, and the data could be used to discriminate.”\n\nThe science-fiction applications, meanwhile, often rely on the premise that healthy people would voluntarily get invasive brain implants – to communicate with computers, for example, or move objects with their minds.\n\nThis is unlikely. If it happened, and if the technology advanced, it might well raise surveillance concerns. But, Hendricks said, it’s extremely unclear if such surveillance would be significantly more useful than the vast amount of granular data – browser histories and purchase data – that big tech companies already have.\n\n“We have so many ways to influence people through language and simple visual media,” Hendricks said. “I don’t think that [brain implants] would catch up for a long time.”\n\nAs for brain uploading, Hendricks said the idea came from people in technology who “think about computers too much”, convincing themselves that the brain is hardware and the self is software that can be run on it – or in a computer, or on a robot.\n\n“If I could really be uploaded to be made immortal in a computer, then I should be happy to just kill myself right now as long as someone tells me, like, oh, you’re living in that metal box over there,” he said. “But I don’t think many people would take that bet. I think instinctively we know that’s bullshit.”",

    "text": "When the far-right activist Tommy Robinson emerged from a London courtroom this week after a judge cleared him of a terrorism charge, he gave thanks to the man he said had bankrolled his defense.\n\n“Elon Musk, I’m forever grateful. If you didn’t step in and fund my legal fight I’d probably be in jail,” Robinson said. “Thank you, Elon.”\n\nIn the period immediately after Musk’s messy departure from the White House, the Tesla CEO repeatedly suggested that he was done with politics. Investors who had pushed him to refocus on his businesses were delighted. Tesla’s stock rose. The months since, however, have proved that Musk has failed to abandon his political preoccupations. He has done the opposite, veering further into election conspiracies and extreme anti-immigration views.\n\nMusk’s political endeavors since leaving the Trump administration have included leveraging his social media platform as a pulpit to influence New York City’s mayoral race and creating an AI-generated, rightwing knockoff of Wikipedia. In interviews, he has said there is a “homeless industrial complex” of nonprofits ruining California and complained that “it should be okay to have white pride”. On X, he proclaimed that the UK would fall into civil war and western civilization would collapse.\n\nThe same day that Robinson extended his gratitude, Musk posted claims that “illegals” were committing voting fraud in the US, retweeted complaints about video games becoming “woke” and called established media outlets leftist propaganda.\n\nThe political fixations of the world’s richest man have taken a toll on his businesses. A Yale study published last month found that his divisive rhetoric and far-right political affiliations cost Tesla about a million vehicle sales between his acquisition of Twitter in 2022 and April of this year. Consumer polling found that Tesla’s brand loyalty plummeted over the course of 2025 as Musk’s “department of government efficiency” dismantled government agencies, which included cuts to foreign aid that experts project could result in around 14 million deaths globally.\n\nMusk’s personal approval rating has also sunk to record lows this year, according to multiple surveys. He held the lowest favorability out of 14 major political newsmakers, according to a Gallup poll from August, ranking five percentage points below Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu, who is facing charges of war crimes from the international criminal court. A separate Quinnipiac poll in June found that only around 2 in 10 women in the US held a favorable view of Musk.\n\nYet the social and financial backlash to Musk’s politics has not quelled his public embrace of the far-right, and in characteristically stubborn fashion, he has begun flaunting his affiliations more openly while suggesting that being labeled racist or extremist is now meaningless to him. Tesla’s shareholders have also continued to endorse him. On Thursday, they voted by a huge margin in favor of a $1tn compensation package for him, slated to be the biggest in corporate history.\n\nInsulated from major financial consequences and existing in an online bubble of his own making, Musk has positioned himself as a fixture of the international far-right even after his influence within the Trump administration has waned.\n\nBacking the international far-right\n\nMusk has long maintained friendly relationships with some of the world’s most prominent far-right leaders, ringing in the year with an appearance at a campaign rally for the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party. His speech, which came days after he was accused of giving fascist salutes on stage following Trump’s inauguration, drew criticism from Jewish leaders after he told the crowd that Germany has “too much of a focus on past guilt, and we need to move beyond that”.\n\nIn recent months, Musk’s affiliations with pro-nativist political movements have gone beyond established parties to direct engagement with far-right activists and influencers via X. Robinson, a longtime anti-Islam campaigner who has previously been jailed for contempt of court after libeling a teenage Syrian refugee, has received special attention.\n\n“It is time for the English to ally with the hard men, like Tommy Robinson, and fight for their survival or they shall surely all perish,” Musk wrote on X in response to a video of a man being stabbed to death. He claimed the same “will happen to all of England if the tide of illegal immigration is not turned.”\n\nIn September, Musk appeared via livestream at one of Robinson’s rallies in London to call for the UK government to be dissolved and claim that immigration was causing “the destruction of Britain”.\n\n“Whether you choose violence or not, violence is coming to you. You either fight back or you die,” Musk told the crowd. Downing Street later condemned Musk’s remarks, saying they threatened to incite violence and intimidation.\n\nMusk’s acquisition of Twitter in 2022 has overall been a boon to the UK’s far right. The company’s previous ownership had banned many of the movement’s leaders for violating policies around hateful conduct. Musk reinstated activists from Britain’s most prominent neo-Nazi group and restored Robinson’s account, which had been removed after he posted calls to mass deport Muslim refugees.\n\nMusk has also become the most prominent backer of the fringe UK political movement Restore Britain, with the Texas-based billionaire posting positive messages about its leader Rupert Lowe. Restore Britain published a 113-page policy document earlier this year outlining a plan for the mass deportation of all undocumented immigrants, which suggested using military aircraft to put thousands of people on deportation flights to Rwanda regardless of their country of origin.\n\nMusk’s increasing meddling into UK politics has drawn criticism from the country’s Labour government, as well as anti-hate groups and other establishment politicians.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to TechScape Free weekly newsletter A weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The idea that artificial intelligence would become too “politically correct” and “woke” in its outputs has haunted Musk for years, and he has frequently indulged in futuristic thought experiments to voice his fears.\n\n“If it says everyone must be diverse it means there can be no straight white men, then you and I will be executed by AI,” Musk said on Joe Rogan’s podcast last week, tweaking the famous “paper clip problem”, which theorizes that an AI would decimate humanity to make paper clips if instructed that manufacturing them was its sole purpose.\n\nMusk’s answer to his version of AI’s alignment problem has been to use his xAI artificial intelligence company, which has taken up much of his attention since leaving government, to create products that more closely align with his views. In theory, he’s creating right-wing copies of popular sites and products that function the same way as their originals. In practice, they have malfunctioned. Musk’s attempt to create a more conservative-leaning AI model has led to incidents in recent months like xAI’s Grok chatbot spouting conspiracies about “white genocide” and calling itself “MechaHitler”.\n\nAs well as speaking to online allies aligned with him, Musk has also used his social media platform to attack non-profits and politicians he opposes.\n\nMusk was at the center of a campaign last month against the Anti-Defamation League, the US’ most prominent Jewish advocacy organization, which faced rightwing backlash for an article that documented connections between slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk’s group Turning Point USA and extremists. Musk claimed that the ADL “hates Christians” and encouraged murder and shared rightwing influencers’ posts attacking the group. The campaign led to the ADL removing its entire glossary of extremism, which it had previously touted as the most comprehensive resource on extremist organizations and movements.\n\nMusk once again used his platform in the lead up to New York City’s mayoral election, using a paid promotion feature to boost the reach of his post attacking Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani, crowbaring his tweet into more users’ feeds. On election day, he reposted a series of tweets that misinterpreted the election system and suggested a voting conspiracy was at play.\n\nAs an extension of Musk’s pursuit of an alternative information ecosystem, xAI also launched a Wikipedia imitation called “Grokipedia” last month that Musk has touted as superior and free of bias. Researchers have found that it contained a large amount of false information on public figures and events, had copied some entries almost verbatim from Wikipedia and emphasized rightwing narratives about slavery, immigration and trans rights.\n\nAn entry on Britain First, described by Wikipedia as a “neo-Fascist party,” referred to the organization as a “patriotic political party”.",

    "text": "Google’s third-generation folding phone promises to be more durable than all others as the first with full water and dust resistance while also packing lots of advanced AI and an adaptable set of cameras.\n\nThe Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more.\n\nThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold builds on last year’s excellent 9 Pro Fold by doing away with gears in the hinge along its spine allowing it to deal with dust, which has been the achilles heel of all foldable phones until now, gumming up the works in a way that just isn’t a problem for regular slab phones.\n\nBut, as with all foldable phones, the Pixel is very expensive, costing £1,749 (€1,899/$1,799/A$2,699), sitting far above the £1,199 Pixel 10 Pro XL and rubbing shoulders with the equally pricey Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7.\n\nView image in fullscreen Google says the new gearless hinge of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is capable of surviving more than 10 years of folding. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nImproved durability aside, not a lot has visibly changed on the outside since the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. The external screen is a smidgen larger thanks to thinner bezels, and the inside and outside screens are slightly brighter than before. The Fold is a great shape when closed for phone-based tasks and can comfortably fit two full-size apps side by side on the excellent internal screen when open.\n\nHowever, the Pixel is heavy and looks chunky compared with Samsung’s impressively thin and light Z Fold 7. It is 258g, which you can feel in use and the pocket, while being significantly thicker than a normal phone and the latest rivals.\n\nThe Fold has the same Google Tensor G5 chip as the rest of the Pixel 10 line with 16GB of RAM and at least 256GB of storage. It performs just as well as the Pixel 10 Pro, feeling rapid in use and capable of handling most tasks without breaking a sweat. Those seeking the highest frame rates in high-end games are better served by rivals with Qualcomm’s top Snapdragon chip, however.\n\nAs with all foldables, the battery life of the Fold varies a lot depending on which screen you use most. On light days with about five hours of active screen use spread equally between the inside and outside displays, mostly on wifi, the Pixel managed about 38 to 40 hours between charges. On heavier days on 5G with more inside screen use, it lasted about 28 hours, ending the day with 25% left in the tank. That’s not terrible but is some way behind the best rivals or big-screen slab phones, including the Pixel 10 Pro XL.\n\nView image in fullscreen A full charge takes 90 minutes, hitting 50% in 30 minutes with a 30W or greater USB-C power adaptor (not included). It also supports 15W Qi2 wireless charging. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nSpecifications\n\nOutside screen: 6.4in FHD+ 120Hz OLED (408ppi)\n\nInside screen: 8in 120Hz OLED (373ppi)\n\nProcessor: Google Tensor G5\n\nRAM: 16GB\n\nStorage: 256GB, 512GB or 1TB\n\nOperating system: Android 16\n\nCamera: 48MP wide, 10.5MP ultrawide, 10.8MP 5x telephoto; two 10MP selfie cameras\n\nConnectivity: 5G, eSim, USB-C, wifi 7, NFC, Bluetooth 6, UWB, Thread, GNSS\n\nWater resistance: IP68 (1.5 metres for 30 minutes)\n\nDimensions folded: 155.2 x 76.3 x 10.8mm\n\nDimensions unfolded: 155.2 x 150.4 x 5.2mm\n\nWeight: 258g\n\nAndroid 16, Magic Cue and Gemini\n\nView image in fullscreen When running two apps on screen at once, one can be pushed beyond the edge to make more space. Tapping it brings the app back into full view. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nThe Fold runs the same Android 16 software as the rest of the Pixel 10 Pro line, which introduces a bold and colourful appearance plus lots of cutting-edge AI tools crammed into almost every corner of the phone.\n\nSome of the highlights include the Gemini chatbot, which can see and hear what you do, interact with your apps and is generally quite useful, plus a new real-time translation system for phone calls that replicates the caller’s voice.\n\nMagic Cue is the standout feature, which is a little helper that runs in the background on your device, processing your data from various Google apps and popping up with timely information when you need it. It understands context, so when a friend texts to ask about when your flight lands it will suggest your flight details from your calendar so you can paste them straight into your conversation, or when you call a business it will show your order details from Gmail right in the phone app. It is low-key great.\n\nIt also has a few modifications to make the most of the big internal screen. A task bar at the bottom of the display makes putting apps into split screen easy. You can also resize apps beyond the border of the screen, similar to the Honor Magic V5 and OnePlus Open, which adds a bit of flexibility to running two apps side by side.\n\nThe Fold also comes with a subscription for Google AI Pro for a year, worth £19 a month, granting access to more powerful Gemini AI models and 2TB of cloud storage for photos, files and email. The phone will receive updates until October 2032.\n\nSustainability\n\nView image in fullscreen The recycled aluminium frame feels high quality and solid. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nThe battery is rated to last in excess of 1,000 full charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity. The phone is repairable by Google, third-party shops or self-repair with manuals and parts due to be available.\n\nThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold contains 29% recycled materials by weight including aluminium, cobalt, copper, glass, gold, plastic, rare-earth elements, tin and tungsten. The company breaks down the phone’s environmental impact in its report and will recycle old devices for free.\n\nCamera\n\nView image in fullscreen The camera app has multiple modes but it is easiest to shoot photos with the Pixel closed like a regular phone. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nThe 10 Pro Fold has a very similar camera set up to last year’s 9 Pro Fold and the new Pixel 10, including a 48-megapixel main, 10.5MP ultra wide and a 10.8MP 5x telephoto camera, which out-zooms folding phone rivals, plus two 10MP selfie cameras.\n\nThe main camera shoots good photos across a range of conditions, although it can suffer from a little blur and grain at lower light levels. Google’s night mode is still the best in the business when it gets really dark. The ultra-wide camera is solid, while the 5x optical zoom telephoto camera can meaningfully close the distance to objects. The latter can be a bit soft on detail in less than ideal light. Just like the regular Pixel 10 the camera shoots good photos and video most will be pleased with, but it can’t match the Pixel 10 Pro line, which for this price you might expect.\n\nThe Fold has a few tricks of its own, including various shooting modes using both screens or propped up at angles when partly folded, plus the ability to shoot selfies with the main camera. The handy Made You Look feature shows an animation on the outside screen that reacts when your child looks its way and smiles, keeping their attention long enough for you to shoot a photo, although unfortunately it uses one of the selfie cameras, not the primary camera, so it’s more for fun than a great photo.\n\nPrice\n\nThe Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold costs from £1,749 (€1,899/$1,799/A$2,699).\n\nFor comparison, the Pixel 10 costs £799, Pixel 10 Pro costs £999, the Pixel 10 Pro XL costs £1,199, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 costs £1,799 and the Honor Magic V5 costs £1,699.99.\n\nVerdict\n\nThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold is a minor update to the already good 9 Pro Fold from last year, but one that could have a bigger impact down the line. As the first properly dust-resistant foldable it sets a new durability benchmark, slowly bringing the devices up to par with standard slab phones.\n\nThe inside screen is still necessarily softer than a regular hardened glass to allow it to fold, however, so you must still be careful with it. A fingernail can leave a permanent mark if you press hard enough.\n\nThe added Qi2 magnetic accessory and charging support is just as good in the Fold as it is in other Pixels. The phone is rapid, has reasonable battery life, runs great software and has the best cutting-edge AI around. The cameras are good for a foldable, too, although can’t match the best normal phones.\n\nThe Pixel does a great job of balancing being a regular phone when closed and a great tablet when open, but it is fat and heavy compared with the dramatically thinner and lighter Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7.\n\nPros: a phone and tablet in one, dust and water resistant, Qi2 magnetic accessory and charging, great tablet screen, good performance, good cameras with 5x zoom, packed with AI including Magic Cue, Google AI Pro included for a year, seven years of software updates. Cons: extremely expensive, more fragile and costlier to repair than a regular device, thick and heavy, cameras can’t match regular Pixel 10 Pro, battery life could be better, fewer power-user features than rivals.",

    "text": "It may not look as different as the redesigned Pro models this year or be as wafer thin as the new iPhone Air, but the iPhone 17 marks a big year for the standard Apple smartphone.\n\nThe Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more.\n\nThat’s because Apple has finally brought one of the best features of modern smartphones to its base-model flagship phone: a super-smooth 120Hz screen.\n\nAnd it has done so, while also doubling the starting storage, without increasing the price. The iPhone 17 still starts at the same £799 (€949/$799/A$1,399) as its predecessor, sitting below the £999 Air and £1,099 Pro, while offering a lot of iPhone for the money.\n\nFrom the outside it doesn’t look as if anything has changed since the iPhone 16, but the 17 is ever so slightly taller to squeeze in the bigger screen with slimmer borders without making the phone materially larger. The 6.3in screen now matches the super-bright display on the 17 Pro covered with significantly toughened glass to better resist scratches.\n\nView image in fullscreen A new anti-glare coating on the display makes it a lot easier to see and use the screen outside in bright, direct sunlight. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nThe 120Hz “Pro Motion” tech is the best bit, doubling the refresh rate of the screen to make scrolling and animations much smoother and more responsive. It has been a feature common to rival smartphones for years, but Apple has until this point reserved it for Pro models of the iPhone, MacBooks and iPads.\n\nThe 17 also has the previously Pro-only always-on display feature, which shows the time, widgets and notifications while the phone is idle. And it runs the same iOS 26 with Apple’s new glass-like interface design as the rest of the iPhone lineup. It looks a bit different and some elements have been simplified or condensed to get out of the way of the content you’re trying to see, but generally it works the same with some nice touches here and there.\n\nSpecifications\n\nScreen: 6.3in Super Retina XDR (120Hz OLED) (460ppi)\n\nProcessor: Apple A19\n\nRAM: 8GB\n\nStorage: 256 or 512GB\n\nOperating system: iOS 26\n\nCamera: 48MP main + 48MP UW; 18MP front-facing\n\nConnectivity: 5G, wifi 7, NFC, Bluetooth 6, Thread, USB-C, Satellite, UWB and GNSS\n\nWater resistance: IP68 (6 metres for 30 mins)\n\nDimensions: 149.6 x 71.5 x 7.95mm\n\nWeight: 177g\n\nRapid A19 chip and solid battery life\n\nView image in fullscreen The phone fully charges in 82 minutes using a 20W or greater USB-C power adapter (not included), hitting 50% in 21 minutes. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nThe iPhone 17 has Apple’s new A19 chip, which is only a little less powerful than the A19 Pro in the other models this year, making it one of the fastest chips in a smartphone. Apple still has a lead over Android rivals in processors, even in cheaper models.\n\nAs a result the 17 handles everything you could want to do with a phone with aplomb. Battery life is also good for a phone of this size, lasting a solid 44 hours of mixed usage across wifi and 5G between charges, actively using the screen for about six hours and with the always-on display feature turned on. That’s slightly shorter than its predecessor, but slightly longer than the similarly sized 17 Pro and a fair bit longer than the iPhone Air. Most people will need to charge the 17 every other day.\n\nSustainability\n\nView image in fullscreen The smooth recycled aluminium body and matt glass back feel solid and premium without a case. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nThe battery will last in excess of 1,000 full-charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity and can be replaced for £95. Out-of-warranty screen repairs cost £349.\n\nThe phone contains more than 30% recycled material including aluminium, cobalt, copper, gold, lithium, plastic, rare earth elements, steel, tin and tungsten. The company breaks down its environmental impact in a report. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products.\n\nCamera\n\nView image in fullscreen The camera app has been simplified by hiding more of the features behind a sliding selector and pop-out menus to make more room for the viewfinder. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nThe 17 has two 48-megapixel cameras on the back – one main and one ultrawide – plus Apple’s new 18MP centre stage selfie camera, as seen on the iPhone 17 Pro and Air.\n\nThe main camera remains unchanged from the iPhone 16 and shoots great photos across a range of lighting conditions. Occasionally it can be blown out by bright lights or suffer from a bit of blur or grain in low-light conditions, but it is a reliably good point-and-shoot camera. It can perform a 2x crop zoom, which works great in good light and OK in dimmer indoor lighting. The ultrawide is an upgrade on predecessors, shooting with greater detail and range. It works particularly well for the macro mode for closeup photos.\n\nThe camera can digitally zoom up 10x, but the resulting photos lack detail and sharpness. A real camera zoom is still limited to the Pro models on an iPhone.\n\nThe new front-facing camera shoots solid selfies, which are slightly better than previous iPhones. But its party piece is the ability to automatically pan and zoom to fit everyone in for group shots, no matter which orientation you hold the phone. Shooting landscape photos while holding your phone in portrait is surprisingly useful.\n\nThe 17 has plenty of modes to play about with and shoots great video, including a dual-capture feature that records from the front and back cameras at the same time to put the photographer into the shot in a little window.\n\nPrice\n\nThe iPhone 17 starts from £799 (€949/$799/A$1,399) with 256GB of storage.\n\nFor comparison, the iPhone 16e costs £599, iPhone Air costs £999, iPhone 17 Pro costs £1,099, the iPhone 17 Pro Max costs £1,199, the Google Pixel 10 costs £799, the Samsung Galaxy S25 costs £699 and the Fairphone 6 costs £499.\n\nVerdict\n\nThe iPhone 17 may not look all that different from last year’s model, but it is a meaningful upgrade on all the standard model iPhones that have come before.\n\nThat’s because it has key features pulled down from Apple’s pricier Pro models, including a significantly better, brighter and 120Hz-smooth screen. It’s a must-have feature that has been standard on rival phones for years. The always-on display is super handy too, while double the starting storage to 256GB and about two-day battery life is very welcome. For the first time in many years, using the iPhone 17 doesn’t feel like a significant downgrade from the Pro models.\n\nThe dual camera on the back is good, but the lack of a telephoto option keeps it from being great. The iPhone 17 still feels compact for a modern phone, and while not quite as featherlight as the iPhone Air, it isn’t exactly heavy.\n\nUnless you need a camera zoom, the standard iPhone 17 is the one to get for Apple buyers. It’s great.\n\nPros: rapid, great 120Hz screen, good dual camera with macro mode, at least 256GB storage, great size, action and camera control buttons, USB-C, good battery life, long software support, Face ID. Cons: no telephoto camera, samey design, not the thinnest, lightest or most powerful model.",

    "text": "The iPhone Air is a technical and design marvel that asks: how much are you willing to give up for a lightweight and ultra-slender profile?\n\nThe Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more.\n\nBeyond the obvious engineering effort that has gone into creating one of the slimmest phones ever made, the Air is a reductive exercise that boils down the iPhone into the absolute essentials in a premium body.\n\nCut away the rear cameras, slim down the battery, remove the stereo speakers and maximise the screen, and what is left is an impressive sliver of titanium and glass.\n\nDoing so isn’t cheap. The iPhone Air starts at £999 (€1,199/$999/A$1,799), sitting in between the standard £799 iPhone 17 and the £1,099 17 Pro models.\n\nView image in fullscreen The Air’s slim lines are slightly betrayed by the plateau and camera lens that protrude from the back, doubling the phone’s thickness to about 11.3mm, reminiscent of Google’s Pixel bar\n\nPhotos don’t do the Air justice. You know it is something special as soon as you pick it up. Its 5.64mm-thick frame feels thinner thanks to soft edges and light weight that’s 12g less than the already quite light iPhone 17.\n\nThe glass lump on the back contains most of the guts of the phone with the rest dedicated to the battery. The usual iPhone buttons line the sides including the camera control and action buttons. The earpiece speaker in the top is the only one: it is pretty good but you can tell there’s no stereo sound when watching videos, which is a bit of a shame as the 6.5in screen is smooth, bright and fantastic.\n\nThe Air behaves just like any other modern iPhone. It runs iOS 26 with its glass-like design, has all the same apps, Face ID and is super responsive. There is only one hiccup and that’s the lack of a nano sim card tray, as the iPhone Air relies entirely on eSim. In the US Apple has only supported eSims since the iPhone 14, but models sold everywhere else had nano sim slots, until the Air.\n\nView image in fullscreen The sides of the phone are only a little thicker than the buttons. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nMost of the major networks in the UK can provide eSims, but the experience of setting it up or moving between phones isn’t great for all of them and not all budget providers support them. The mobile networks have some work to do to make eSims a good experience everywhere.\n\nSpecifications\n\nScreen: 6.5in Super Retina XDR (120Hz OLED) (460ppi)\n\nProcessor: Apple A19 Pro (5-core GPU)\n\nRAM: 12GB\n\nStorage: 256, 512GB or 1TB\n\nOperating system: iOS 26\n\nCamera: 48MP rear; 18MP front-facing\n\nConnectivity: 5G eSim-only, wifi 7, NFC, Bluetooth 6, Thread, USB-C, satellite, UWB and GNSS\n\nWater resistance: IP68 (6 metres for 30 mins)\n\nDimensions: 156.2 x 74.7 x 5.64mm\n\nWeight: 165g\n\nA19 Pro chip\n\nView image in fullscreen The Air takes about 105 minutes to fully charge, hitting 60% in 35 minutes using a 20W or greater USB-C power adaptor (not included). Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nThe Air has the A19 Pro chip similar to the iPhone 17 Pro, but with one fewer GPU core, reducing its performance a little for games and other graphics-intensive tasks. It feels rapid in daily tasks but gets noticeably warmer by the camera lump when doing intensive jobs.\n\nDespite most of the body being dedicated to the battery, a smaller capacity cell is the Air’s first big concession to slenderness. The battery life is shorter than other iPhones, but isn’t as bad as you might imagine. For relatively light days with the screen actively used for five hours for browsing, messaging and watching video mostly on wifi, the Air lasted a decent 40 hours between charges.\n\nView image in fullscreen Qi2 or MagSafe magnetic wireless chargers, such as the Twelve South PowerBug , are likely to make living with the Air easier for quick top-ups during the day.\n\nOn heavier days, shooting photos, using mapping on 5G out and about, listening to music, messaging and watching video on the commute, the Air lasted about 30 hours, ending the day with roughly 25% left. It should see out most days with a nightly charge, but if you do lots of gaming or other more intensive tasks you may need low power mode.\n\nSustainability\n\nView image in fullscreen The slender frame still contains a fairly easy-to-replace battery, which may be needed after about 1,000 charge cycles. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nThe battery will last in excess of 1,000 full-charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity and can be replaced for £109. Out-of-warranty screen repairs cost £349. Specialists iFixit awarded the iPhone Air a seven out of 10 for repairability.\n\nIt contains more than 35% recycled material including aluminium, cobalt, gold, lithium, rare earth elements, steel, tin, titanium and tungsten. The company breaks down the phone’s environmental impact in its report. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products.\n\nCamera\n\nView image in fullscreen The camera behaves the same as most iPhones, but the lack of ultrawide and telephoto options simplifies things a bit. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nThe camera is the second big concession. The Air only has a single 48-megapixel camera on the back with the new and improved 18MP selfie camera with Centre Stage tech from the iPhone 17 line on the front.\n\nThe main camera matches that from the regular iPhone 17, not the larger sensor from the 17 Pro, but performs admirably. It can shoot great photos and video in good lighting and manages dim indoor light fairly well. It can look a bit soft and grainy at times and won’t win any camera awards, but generally shoots decent photos. It can perform a 2x crop zoom, which is pretty good in brighter scenes, but zoom further and your photos have all the hallmarks of digital zoom: surfaces and people look a bit soft and detail is lost in more distant subjects.\n\nView image in fullscreen The iPhone Air’s zoom is pretty good in brighter scenes but loses detail on more distant subjects. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nThe lack of an ultrawide and telephoto camera certainly hampers the shots you can get. The only other iPhone with a single rear camera is the lower cost iPhone 16e.\n\nThe 18MP front-facing camera automatically pans and zooms to fit everyone in group shots, and can shoot landscape selfies without having to turn the phone sideways, which is a neat trick. You can also shoot video from the front and rear cameras at the same time to put the photographer in the frame in a little window.\n\nPrice\n\nThe iPhone Air costs from £999 (€1,199/$999/A$1,799) with 256GB of storage.\n\nFor comparison, the iPhone 16e costs £599, iPhone 17 is £799, iPhone 17 Pro is £1,099, the iPhone 17 Pro Max costs £1,199, the Google Pixel 10 costs £799, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is £899 and the Fairphone 6 sells for £499.\n\nVerdict\n\nThe iPhone Air is a remarkable design seeking a problem to solve. I’m not sure many people have looked at their current smartphone and wished it would be thinner rather than having longer battery life and a better camera.\n\nThe super-slender frame feels transformative when you first pick it up, but the novelty quickly wears off. As with Samsung’s equally thin Galaxy S25 Edge, the lighter weight is the most meaningful change making it easier to hold and pocket. The Air has a big screen but won’t weigh you down.\n\nThe battery life is better than expected and should see out most days with some left in the tank when new, which may not be the case after a couple of years of use. Apple sells a smart MagSafe battery to add another 65% capacity to the Air, but slapping it on the back removes the benefit of the thin and light design. So does adding a case.\n\nThe biggest concession is the single camera on the back. The lack of ultrawide and telephoto options is a cut too far for me using a phone as my primary method for capturing memories.\n\nBut if you are an Apple buyer who wants a slender novelty that is great to hold and use, the iPhone Air is a special piece of hardware. For everyone else there are better options elsewhere.\n\nPros: super thin and lightweight, great screen, good single rear camera, upgraded Centre Stage selfie camera, top performance, long software support, Face ID. Cons: no ultrawide or telephoto cameras, expensive, relatively short battery life, deserves to be used without a case, lack of cutting-edge AI.",

    "text": "The 17 Pro is Apple’s biggest redesign of the iPhone in years, chucking out the old titanium sides and all-glass backs for a new aluminium unibody design, a huge full-width camera lump on the back and some bolder colours.\n\nThe Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more.\n\nThat alone will make the iPhone 17 Pro popular for those looking to upgrade and be seen with the newest model. But with the change comes an increase in price to £1,099 (€1,299/$1,099/A$1,999), crossing the £1,000 barrier for the first time for Apple’s smallest Pro phone, which now comes with double the starting storage.\n\nFrom the front it looks like any recent Pro iPhone with the Dynamic Island containing the selfie camera at the top of the super bright and smooth screen. It is one of the best screens on a phone but identical to the regular iPhone 17, which has been upgraded this year.\n\nView image in fullscreen Higher peak brightness and a new anti-glare coating on the screen help cut down on reflections in bright light, making it easier to use outside. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nThe aluminium sides have been softened with a slight rounding to the edges, giving the phone a nice and comfortable feel in your hand without being too slippery. The phone has gained 5g in weight, which has pushed it over the 200g mark, making it on the heavier side for a smaller handset.\n\nA glass panel slightly larger than a credit card is inlaid into the aluminium body and is where MagSafe or Qi2.2 chargers and accessories attach. The large metal “plateau” at the top houses the cameras, which is even bigger than the camera bar on a Pixel. The aluminium will not crack like glass when dropped but it is more scratch-prone, particularly around the edges of the plateau, so a case is still prudent.\n\nView image in fullscreen The home and lock screens of iOS 26 now have a glassy, more rounded look to text and icons. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nThe handset runs the same iOS 26 as the rest of the iPhone lineup, which introduced Apple’s new “Liquid Glass” interface design. Generally it works well, but it has caused a bit of division over the transparency effects used for buttons and other elements, which blend into the background a little too much sometimes.\n\nSpecifications\n\nScreen: 6.3in Super Retina XDR (120Hz OLED) (460ppi)\n\nProcessor: Apple A19 Pro\n\nRAM: 12GB\n\nStorage: 256, 512GB or 1TB\n\nOperating system: iOS 26\n\nCamera: 48MP main, 48MP UW and 48MP 4x zoom, 18MP front-facing\n\nConnectivity: 5G, wifi 7, NFC, Bluetooth 6, Thread, USB-C, Satellite, UWB and GNSS\n\nWater resistance: IP68 (6 metres for 30 mins)\n\nDimensions: 150 x 71.9 x 8.75mm\n\nWeight: 204g\n\nFaster and cooler A19 Pro chip\n\nView image in fullscreen The iPhone fully charges in 76 minutes via USB-C, hitting 70% in half an hour using a 40W adaptor (not included) or 96 minutes using a Qi2 25W charger such as the Belkin UltraCharge 2-in-1\n\nThe 17 Pro has a new Apple A19 Pro chip at its heart, which is coupled for the first time in an iPhone with a vapour chamber cooling system. It is a common technique used in many high-performing Android phones and extracts heat from the chip, dispersing it into the rest of the phone’s body to cool it down and keep it running at peak performance for longer.\n\nIt works well, with the back staying cooler than previous iPhones when playing games for extended sessions while producing better frame rates and being less sweaty to hold.\n\nThe battery life is solid for a phone of this size, lasting about 42 hours between charges with about six hours of active screen use on a mix of 5G and wifi, which is about two hours longer than last year’s model. On heavy-use days out and about or playing lots of games, the 17 Pro still managed to end the day with a good 25% left in the tank. Most people will need to charge the phone every other day for regular use.\n\nSustainability\n\nView image in fullscreen The camera plateau stops the iPhone 17 Pro rocking around on a desk as much as previous models. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nThe battery will last in excess of 1,000 full-charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity and can be replaced for £109. Out-of-warranty screen repairs cost £349. The specialists iFixit awarded the phone a seven out of 10 for repairability.\n\nIt contains more than 30% recycled material, including aluminium, cobalt, copper, gold, lithium, rare-earth elements, steel, tin and tungsten. The company breaks down the phone’s environmental impact in its report. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products.\n\nCamera\n\nView image in fullscreen The simplified camera app automates more of the photo-taking and hides many features behind sliding buttons. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nThere are three 48-megapixel cameras on the back and a new 18MP selfie camera with a few new tricks on the front.\n\nThe main and ultra-wide cameras are very similar to last year, shoot some great photos across a range of lighting conditions and are particularly good for street photography with solid detail. The main camera offers a 2x crop zoom, which is great, appearing similar in detail and colour to 1x shots in good light, although a little more grainy in dimmer lighting.\n\nNew for this year is an upgraded telephoto camera that is now 4x at 48MP, up from 5x at 12MP, which produces very good, well-balanced photos that are full of detail. It can manage an 8x crop zoom similar to the main camera, which is equally good in bright light with only a slight degradation of detail. Both zoom levels do pretty well in dimmer indoor light, too.\n\nView image in fullscreen Zooming beyond 15-20x to a max of 40x magnification, the photos have obvious signs of being blown up by digital zoom. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nAll three cameras shoot some of the best video on a phone and have many other features, including an excellent macrophotography mode and the ability to shoot video from the front and rear cameras simultaneously, placing the operator into a little window. Apple’s automatic portrait mode is solid and works with objects, not only people and pets.\n\nFinally, the selfie camera has had its first upgrade on an iPhone in many years, beefed up to an 18MP sensor with Apple’s Centre Stage tech from its iPads and Macs. It has the ability to automatically pan and zoom to keep you in frame for video calls but it can also expand the frame to shoot landscape selfies when holding the phone in portrait orientation. It’s a novel solution to the problem of trying to fit everyone in for group selfies without having to turn the phone.\n\nPrice\n\nThe iPhone 17 Pro costs from £1,099 (€1,299/$1,099/A$1,999) with 256GB of storage.\n\nFor comparison, the iPhone 16e costs £599, iPhone 17 costs £799, iPhone Air costs £999, iPhone 17 Pro Max costs £1,199, the Google Pixel 10 Pro costs £999, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra costs £1,099 and the Fairphone 6 costs £499.\n\nVerdict\n\nThe 17 Pro is the first different-looking iPhone in years, which instantly makes it stand out despite not being functionally all that different from recent models.\n\nThe new aluminium unibody design feels nice, although it will scratch more easily than glass. The screen and performance are top-notch, while the battery life is solid for a fairly compact handset. It is a really nice iPhone and one of the very best phones that isn’t ginormous.\n\nBut this year it competes with the super-thin iPhone Air, which steals some of the limelight, and an upgraded standard iPhone 17, which is cheaper but matches the Pro on screen quality for the first time, although it lacks a zoom camera.\n\nThat leaves the camera as the big differentiator. The 17 Pro has top-notch cameras including a new and improved telephoto camera, which is one of the best in the business.\n\nSo for an iPhone buyer who wants a telephoto camera to zoom in on your subjects, the 17 Pro is the model to get. You just have to pay a pretty penny for it.",

    "text": "Apple’s entry level Watch SE has been updated with almost everything from its excellent mid-range Series 11 but costs about 40% less, making it the bargain of iPhone smartwatches.\n\nThe Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more.\n\nThe new Watch SE 3 costs from £219 (€269/$249/A$399), making it one of the cheapest brand-new fully fledged smartwatches available for the iPhone and undercutting the £369 Series 11 and the top-of-the-line £749 Apple Watch Ultra 3.\n\nThe Watch SE line is updated only every few years and has been good value but was missing some crucial things that make Apple’s other watches great. The Watch SE 3’s biggest upgrade is an always-on display, which brings it up to par with the Series line, allowing you to see the time and notifications at a glance without having to twist your wrist to turn the screen on.\n\nView image in fullscreen The screen on and active with the flow watch face (left) and in its idle always-on position (right) with the time still visible. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nThe SE 3 has the older Apple Watch design from 2020’s Series 6 with smaller screens, larger bezels and a choice of 40mm or 44mm case sizes compared with the current Series watches. The screen is also not quite as bright as the more expensive watches, but that is noticeable only in bright direct sunlight. It is still sharp and good looking.\n\nThe SE 3 has the same S10 chip as the Series 11 and Ultra 3, and is just as responsive. It also has the same excellent touch-free gestures, including double tap and wrist flick, which allow you to dismiss notifications, timers and alarms easily.\n\nThe watch also supports all the rest of the general Apple Watch features in watchOS 26, including Apple Pay contactless payments, rich notifications, music control, third-party apps and a range of watch faces.\n\nView image in fullscreen The SE 3 runs all the same apps and services as its more expensive siblings. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nThe battery life of the SE 3 is a little shorter than the Series 11, lasting about a day and a half of general use, including sleep tracking overnight. Most will have to charge it every other day, particularly if they track any workouts. The SE 3 will last up to seven hours of running tracking with GPS and heart rate, which should be long enough for a marathon. A full charge using the magnetic puck takes about an hour, hitting 70% in 30 minutes.\n\nSpecifications\n\nCase size: 40mm or 44mm\n\nCase thickness: 10.7mm\n\nWeight: about 26g or 33g\n\nProcessor: S10\n\nStorage: 64GB\n\nOperating system: watchOS 26\n\nWater resistance: 50 metres (5ATM)\n\nSensors: HR (2nd-gen), skin temp, NFC, GNSS, compass, altimeter\n\nConnectivity: Bluetooth 5.3, wifi 4, NFC, optional 5G\n\nHealth and workout tracking\n\nView image in fullscreen The SE 3 has the same crown and side button as the Series 11 but lacks the metal contacts on the back for taking ECGs. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nOne of the biggest cuts for the SE 3 is the removal of the electrical sensor from the back of the watch, which enables electrocardiograms (ECG) of your heart on the Series and Ultra watches. It also lacks a blood oxygen sensor and hypertension monitoring but it still has an accurate optical heart rate sensor that covers most bases, including high and low heart rate notifications.\n\nThe SE 3 also has a skin temperature sensor, which is used as part of the Vitals app, the sleep tracking and for retrospective ovulation estimates for the cycles tracking app. The watch also does a good job of tracking general workouts, including walks, runs, cycles and other common sports and activities with its GPS.\n\nThe watch also supports offline music playback via Bluetooth headphones, including from subscription services such as Spotify. And it has offline Apple Maps, should you get lost without your phone.\n\nSustainability\n\nView image in fullscreen The recycled aluminium body is available in starlight (as pictured) or midnight (black). Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nApple says the battery should last more than 1,000 full-charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity and can be replaced for £95. Repairs cost between £195 and £229 depending on the model.\n\nIt contains more than 40% recycled material, including aluminium, cobalt, copper, glass, gold, lithium, rare-earth elements, steel, tin, titanium and tungsten. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling for devices, and breaks down the watch’s environmental impact in its report.\n\nPrice\n\nThe Apple Watch SE 3 costs from £219 (€269/$249/A$399) for the 40mm version or £249 (€299/$279/A$449) for 44mm.\n\nFor comparison, the Apple Watch Series 11 costs £369 and the Apple Watch Ultra 3 costs £749.\n\nVerdict\n\nThe Apple Watch SE 3 is the best deal in Apple’s smartwatch line this year, offering almost everything that’s great about the Series 11 but at a significantly cheaper price.\n\nThe new always-on display, S10 chip and watchOS 26 make the SE 3 just as good day to day. The only meaningful feature you miss out on is the ability to take ECGs, but if you know you don’t need it then that’s no loss. The 1.5-day battery life of the 40mm isn’t too bad but the larger 44mm should last a little longer.\n\nThe limited choice of colours is easily remedied with a bright strap, while the older design with smaller screens, larger bezels and a thicker body is easy to live with for the price.\n\nPros: great value Apple Watch, always-on screen, Apple Pay, double-tap and wrist-flick gestures, decent health and fitness tracking, long software support, recycled materials, 50-metre water resistance. Cons: no ECG, no blood oxygen monitoring, no hypertension alerts, old design, only works with an iPhone, no third-party watch faces, screen not super bright in sunlight.",

    "text": "The Oakley Meta Vanguard are new displayless AI glasses designed for running, cycling and action sports with deep Garmin and Strava integration, which may make them the first smart glasses for sport that actually work.\n\nThe Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more.\n\nThey are a replacement for running glasses, open-ear headphones and a head-mounted action cam all in one, and are the latest product of Meta’s partnership with the sunglasses conglomerate EssilorLuxottica, the owner of Ray-Ban, Oakley and many other top brands.\n\nBut where the popular Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarer camera-equipped AI smart glasses are designed for general leisure, the Vanguard are unashamedly sports glasses designed to go fast and capture your efforts as you do it.\n\nThat makes them some of the most expensive screenless AI glasses you can get, starting at a not insignificant £499 (€549/$499/A$789), sitting above the £399 Oakley Meta HSTN and £379 Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarer.\n\nView image in fullscreen The glasses come with three sizes of silicone nose pads to adjust the fit, which is secure and well balanced. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nThe Vanguard don’t look like your standard smart glasses. It is clear Meta brought the technology but Oakley brought the design, fit and finish. The huge wraparound visor, arms and three-point fit system mimic the excellent Oakley Sephara sport glasses, which keeps their 66g frame glued to your head no matter how hard you shake them or how sweaty you get, and they fit under helmets.\n\nThere are two frame colours and four contrast-enhancing lenses to choose from, but no option for prescription lenses. A small button on the left arm near the hinge allows you to turn the glasses on and off so you can use them just as sunglasses.\n\nView image in fullscreen The speaker is next to the large camera button and smaller action button, which can be set to a range of different functions in the Meta AI app. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nA speaker is hidden in each arm that points towards your ear for listening to music, calls or Meta’s AI chatbot. They are some of the best-sounding open-ear speakers you can get and are more than loud enough to be heard over road or wind noise. They can’t match a set of earbuds for bass but for music while running or just out walking they are great. The five beamforming mics also do a very good job of cutting out background noise, even on busy roads, for calls or talking to AI.\n\nThe right arm has a touch panel for controlling playback and volume manually. The music pauses when you take the glasses off, and the volume automatically adjusts to the level of background noise, which works really well while running around roads.\n\nSpecifications\n\nDimensions: 136 x 120 x 59mm\n\nWeight: 66g (258g case)\n\nWater resistance: IP67\n\nCamera: 12MP/3K ultrawide\n\nSpeakers: stereo open ear\n\nMics: 5-mic array\n\nBattery life: 6h music playback (30h with case)\n\nConnectivity: Bluetooth 5.3, wifi 6\n\nStorage: 32GB\n\nHey Meta, take a photo\n\nView image in fullscreen The ultra-wide camera is mounted squarely between your eyes, which you can’t see when wearing them, with an LED directly above that lights when the camera is active. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nThe central camera shoots 12-megapixel photos of reasonable quality and really good stabilised video up to 3K resolution for up to five minutes at a time. It can also shoot hyperlapses, which are a series of action shots stitched together into one sped-up clip, or slo-mo videos at up to 120 frames a second at 720p.\n\nThe camera can’t match a high-end phone but is very good for capturing the action as it happens, similar to the typical mid-range action cameras people strap to themselves. Press the camera button for photos or press and hold for videos, or you can ask Meta AI to take a photo or capture a video hands-free.\n\nAll these features, including music, auto volume and basic voice controls for volume, playback and the camera, work when connected to any Bluetooth device, such as a running watch. But for more advanced AI features the glasses need to be connected to an Android or iPhone running the Meta AI app.\n\nView image in fullscreen The Meta AI app handles settings for the glasses and syncs media, shows language translations and transcriptions of your conversations with the chatbot. Composite: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nYou can ask Meta AI questions like any other chatbot, including what you are looking at using the camera. It can identify plants, translate text and generally interrogate the world around you. It is extremely handy for converting distances and paces between metric and imperial mid-run but isn’t quite as capable as Google’s Gemini on a phone.\n\nYou can also message, send photos and call friends hands-free from the glasses via your phone or with one of Meta’s apps such as WhatsApp, Facebook or Instagram.\n\nHey Meta, what’s my pace?\n\nVanguard’s killer feature is excellent integration with modern Garmin running watches and bike computers. A free Meta AI app on your Garmin links to the Meta AI app on your phone so you can interrogate your stats in real time mid-activity simply by asking.\n\nView image in fullscreen A little LED flashes next to your right eye to tell you when the AI is listening, interacting, or a photo is being taken. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nThe AI can tell you any of your individual metrics, such as pace, distance, heart rate, cadence and others, or the lot by asking for “my stats”, all pulled directly from your Garmin at that moment. It will also read out the pace or other metrics for each lap, mile or kilometre and can use the little LED to the right of your eye to show if you are on target during a pace or heart rate zone workout, turning red when you are outside your zone.\n\nThe Garmin integration also enables the camera to automatically capture your walking, hiking, running or riding workouts. It shoots five-second videos for every kilometre or mile, or when you hit certain milestones such as a burst of pace for a sprint finish or when your heart rate ramps up on a steep incline. Once you have finished, the Meta AI app then stitches the videos together with any you took manually into a highlights reel when you get back. You can then overlay stats from the workout, such as distance, pace, elevation, time, heart rate and power, and send it to Meta’s apps or Strava to automatically add to your existing workout post.\n\nView image in fullscreen The Meta AI app shows workout summaries and processes your auto-capture videos from the glasses. Composite: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nThe whole thing works fantastically, and while you’re not going to want to create videos for every run, automatically capturing highlights from a race without you having to do anything is a great bonus.\n\nCapturing all this video dents the battery life. On an hour-long run listening to music and talking to Meta AI lots of times, with 14 five-second videos auto-captured and 13 minutes of 1080p/30fps video and 14 photos taken manually, the glasses ended the run with 25% battery left.\n\nThey should last for a full marathon with auto-capture turned on, but you may have to be careful with extended shooting to make the full 42km distance.\n\nFor those who don’t use a Garmin, the Meta AI app can integrate with Apple Health, Google Health Connect or Strava to pull data from other watches or bike computers after the fact, including the Apple Watch and Coros devices. But the metrics overlaid on videos are more limited, and you get none of the auto-capture or mid-run stats.\n\nView image in fullscreen The glasses last for up to six hours of continuous music listening and are stored in a chunky Oakley case, which offers four additional charges and will automatically transfer your photos and videos to the cloud while charging. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nSustainability\n\nThe battery in the glasses will maintain at least 80% of its original capacity for 500 full-charge cycles. Replacement lenses (£69), charging cases (£139) and nose pads (£10) will be available but the glasses are not repairable and the batteries not replaceable, ultimately making them disposable. The glasses do not contain recycled material and Meta does not operate trade-in schemes or publish environmental impact reports for the glasses.\n\nPrice\n\nThe Oakley Meta Vanguard cost £499 (€549/$499/A$789).\n\nFor comparison, the Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarer (gen 2) cost from £379, the Oakley Meta HSTN cost from £399, the Oakley Sphaera cost £191 and the Shokz OpenRun Pro 2 cost £169.\n\nVerdict\n\nThe Oakley Meta Vanguard are the best smart glasses for sport I’ve ever tested. They are extremely expensive but it’s very clear they are designed for runners and sports by people who actually run.\n\nBy concentrating on things runners, cyclists and adventure sports people want, such as a fit that won’t quit, lenses that actually block the wind from your eyes, proper water resistance, loud open-ear audio, long battery life and good controls, they would be great without more of the fancy features.\n\nThe nose-mounted camera is very good and could easily replace an action cam for many. The mics continue to work at pace and Meta’s built-in AI is useful for answering those mid-run questions that always pop into your head.\n\nBut the killer feature it is the integration with Garmin, for stats mid-run and for automatic highlights reels of your routes from the camera. It’s just so easy but requires carrying your phone on a run, which is a bit of a drag. Strava and other fitness app links offer something for non-Garmin users.\n\nIf you ditch the phone and use them directly with a running watch for music, the auto-volume and basic voice commands for volume, playback and the camera still work.\n\nThe very high price is hard to swallow but the biggest issue is the irreplaceable battery: you can swap the lenses and nose pads but like most earbuds and other smart glasses they are unrepairable, losing them a star.\n\nPros: big and great lenses, secure fit, well balanced, loud open-ear speakers, noise-mounted camera, IP67 water resistance, long battery life, good case, excellent Garmin integration, good Strava and other fitness app links, swappable lenses and nose pads. Cons: very expensive, unrepairable, needs phone for most advanced features, overkill for just audio on runs.",

    "text": "The biggest, baddest and boldest Apple Watch is back for its third generation, adding a bigger screen, longer battery life and satellite messaging for when lost in the wilderness.\n\nThe Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more.\n\nThe Ultra 3 is Apple’s answer to adventure watches such as Garmin’s Fenix 8 Pro while being a full smartwatch for the iPhone with all the trimmings. As such, it is not cheap, costing from £749 (€899/$799/A$1,399) – £50 less than 2023’s model – sitting above the £369-plus Series 11 and £219 Watch SE 3.\n\nFrom the outside it doesn’t look like a lot has changed for the Ultra 3 over its two-year-old predecessor. Available in natural or black titanium, it is exactly the same size but squeezes in a slightly bigger screen with smaller bezels making it the largest on an Apple Watch.\n\nThe display is much brighter when viewed at an angle, which makes seeing it at a glance a lot easier, and now shows ticking seconds when idle like the Series 10 and 11. It is very bright, covered by super-hard sapphire glass and has one of the very best screens on a watch.\n\nView image in fullscreen The chunky crown and armoured side button help prevent accidental presses during workouts while still making them easy to use with gloves. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nThe Ultra 3 has the same S10 chip as the Series 11 and the same excellent touch-free gestures. Double tap your thumb and index finger to press buttons or scroll, or flick your wrist quickly away from you and back to dismiss alarms, notifications or return to the watch face.\n\nApple has managed to fit a 6% larger battery into the Ultra 3, which lasts a good three-plus days between charges with general usage and sleep tracking over night. Most people will need to put it on the charger every third night, which is a good day longer than any other Apple Watch, although some way behind the week-long battery of adventure watch rivals from Garmin and others.\n\nThe watch fully charges in about two hours, hitting 50% in 30 minutes via the included USB-C magnetic charging puck.\n\nSatellite and 5G\n\nThe watch supports 5G, if you have a compatible phone plan, and has noticeably stronger cellular reception in weaker signal areas for 4G. Apple has also brought its free satellite SOS messaging from the iPhone to the Ultra 3, which allows you to contact the emergency services via text using satellites when out of cellular signal range. Satellites can also be used for Find My location tracking and messages to friends and loved ones, although the latter is only available in the US, Canada and Mexico, and both need a compatible cellular data plan.\n\nThe Ultra 3 runs the same recent watchOS 26 software as the Series 11 and other Apple Watches, which introduced a revamped design and some new watch faces. In addition, the Ultra 3 has an attractive new Waypoint watch face, which has a live compass that shows points of interest around you. It joins a few other information-dense Ultra-exclusive faces, including the Wayfinder and Modular Ultra.\n\nView image in fullscreen A selection of faces for the Ultra 3, including the new Exactograph (top left), Waypoint (top middle) and Flux (top right) and a shot of the always-on display off angle. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nSpecifications\n\nCase size: 49 x 44mm\n\nCase thickness: 12mm\n\nWeight: 61.8g\n\nProcessor: S10\n\nStorage: 64GB\n\nOperating system: watchOS 26\n\nWater resistance: 100 metres (10ATM)\n\nSensors: HR, ECG, spO2, temp, depth, dual-band GPS, compass, altimeter\n\nConnectivity: Bluetooth 5.3, wifi n, NFC, UWB, satellite, optional 5G/eSIM\n\nTop-notch sport and health tracking\n\nView image in fullscreen The domed sapphire glass sensor cluster on the back records most of the health metrics, sitting comfortably on the wrist. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nThe Ultra supports the same comprehensive health and fitness-tracking capabilities as the standard Apple Watch. That includes a wealth of heart health monitoring, such as ECG, abnormal rhythm notifications, blood oxygen tracking, and new hypertension alerts that analyse 30-days of readings for signs of high blood pressure.\n\nIt has Apple’s new sleep score metric, which makes it easier to understand your tracked sleep, plus wrist temperature monitoring, cycle tracking with ovulation estimation and many other tools.\n\nThe Ultra builds on the workout tracking of the standard Apple Watch in a couple of ways. The extra action button in the side can be used to quickly start a workout, but unlike Apple’s other watches you can wait until you have a GPS lock before starting the exercise by pressing it again.\n\nView image in fullscreen The precision start feature is exclusive to the Ultra, but should be on the standard Apple Watch, too. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nThe best bit is a dual-band GPS system that boosts tracking accuracy in tricky environments, such as dense urban areas with tall buildings or in woods. It’s a feature found on the top running watches and has been improved since the initial Ultra to become one of the most accurate on the market, matching or beating the very best in urban GPS stress tests.\n\nIt also tracks a good number of metrics including the usual distance, pace and cadence, plus running power and dynamics, training load and heart rate zones. It can be loaded with structured workouts such as intervals, and it has a very good track detection mode for doing laps. The Ultra has similarly good cycling, swimming and triathlon profiles, plus diving to 40-metre depths and at least 22 other activities.\n\nView image in fullscreen The bright orange action button can be customised to trigger different features, including workouts, a torch, stopwatch, voice memos or other actions. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nCombined with the large and bright screen, and the decent 11 to 14-hour battery life when tracking running at its highest accuracy levels, the Ultra 3 makes for a surprisingly good sports watch.\n\nThe Ultra also supports Apple’s new Workout Buddy AI coach, which works with walks, runs, hikes, cycling and various other training workouts, giving you pep-talks before, during and after activities via Bluetooth headphones. But it requires you to carry an iPhone 15 Pro or later for it to work, which is a drag.\n\nSustainability\n\nApple says the battery should last more than 1,000 full charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity and can be replaced for £95. Damage repairs cost £489.\n\nThe watch contains more than 40% recycled material, including cobalt, copper, gold, lithium, rare earth elements, steel, titanium and tungsten. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling for devices, and breaks down the watch’s environmental impact in its report.\n\nPrice\n\nThe Apple Watch Ultra 3 comes in a choice of two colours and multiple bands costing from £749 (€899/$799/A$1,399).\n\nVerdict\n\nThe Ultra 3 is the biggest, baddest and best Apple Watch the company makes but it isn’t a massive leap over previous models.\n\nOther than satellite SOS messaging, which could genuinely save your life in an emergency, the rest of the watch is simply a refinement of the Ultra 2.\n\nBut the added battery life is very welcome, so is a bigger and fancier screen in the same size watch. New software features are great and the wrist-flick gesture for dismissing things is the best thing added to any Apple Watch in recent memory.\n\nThe Ultra is still a rarer sight than other models, so if you wanted a less ubiquitous Apple Watch this is it. While those looking for a dedicated top-priced sports watch might overlook it in favour of a Garmin or similar, the Ultra 3 has all the ingredients to be a first-rate training companion – as long as you can charge it more frequently – while still being the best smartwatch you can get with an iPhone.\n\nThe Ultra 3 is the best Apple Watch. Just don’t expect it to be a massive upgrade over older Ultra models.\n\nPros: fantastic screen, rugged yet sophisticated design, double-tap and wrist-flick gestures, three-day battery life, 5G and satellite SOS/messaging, top health tracking, great activity tracking with dual-band GPS, extra action button, 100-metre water resistance and 40-metre dive-ready, long software support. Cons: very expensive, only works with an iPhone, no third-party watch faces, no big upgrade on previous Ultra models, shorter battery life than adventure watch rivals.",

    "text": "The latest update to Garmin’s class-leading Fenix adventure watch adds something that could save your life: phone-free communications and emergency messaging on 4G or via satellite.\n\nThe Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more.\n\nThe Fenix 8 Pro takes the already fantastic Fenix 8 and adds in the new cellular tech, plus the option of a cutting-edge microLED screen in a special edition of the watch. It is Garmin’s top model and designed to be the only tool you need to more-or-less go anywhere and track anything.\n\nThat makes it an extremely pricey proposition starting at £1,030 (€1,200, $1,200, A$2,300) for the 47mm OLED version and stretching to a colossal £1,730 (€2,000/$2,000/A$3,399) for the 51mm version with microLED display – almost twice the price of the regular Fenix 8.\n\nYou do get a lot of watch for your money with best-in-class workout, activity and adventure tracking. The full offline maps of the globe can automatically guide you back on to the trail if you get lost without a phone, and look great on the large, sharp and super-bright touchscreen.\n\nView image in fullscreen The Fenix 8 Pro is thicker and heavier than the standard Fenix 8 by 2.2mm and 4g respectively, and pretty chunky on the wrist. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nThe Fenix 8 Pro only comes in 47mm or 51mm case sizes, not the smaller 43mm version Garmin offers in other models, so it is a big watch for big wrists. But the 47mm OLED version as tested does have an extra day of smartwatch-use battery life even with the screen on all the time, lasting a solid eight to nine days between charges.\n\nPhone-free messaging, calls and live tracking\n\nGarmin has its own inReach LTE (4G) and satellite subscription service instead of relying on a watch plan linked to your phone provider, like other smartwatches. But unlike Apple or Google’s satellite-capable devices, emergency SOS messaging is not included for free.\n\nInstead, plans start at £7.99 or equivalent a month, which provides unlimited LTE text and voice messaging, calls and LiveTrack location sharing – so your friends or loved ones can keep an eye on you while out running, cycling or similar – plus emergency satellite SOS messaging.\n\nView image in fullscreen The setup and activation of the inReach subscription is a fairly long-winded affair, but only needs to be done once. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nCheck-ins and texts over satellite are then charged on top, with more expensive plans including various allowances of satellite use, climbing to a £50 a month unlimited plan. The watch comes with a 30-day free trial so you can test out the service.\n\nOnce you have got it set up, you simply head out the door without your phone and the watch will connect to LTE. You can not use it for streaming music or similar, but you can make and take calls, send texts and generally keep in touch with your family and friends.\n\nView image in fullscreen Here are what messages look like on the watch and the recipient’s Garmin Messenger app, including texts, reactions, voice messages and transcriptions. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nWhen you text someone, Garmin sends them an SMS from a random phone number, which they can reply to back to your watch. If they install the Garmin Messenger app, you can then message back and forth via text or voice messages, and make voice calls. Your recipient does not need a Garmin account to use the Messenger app, just a phone number is sufficient to register for texts.\n\nMessaging on the watch works fine but typing out texts on the tiny on-screen keyboard is slow. It has a set of customisable canned responses you can send to speed things up. Voice messages and calls work OK, though as with most smartwatches, you’re not going to want to use it for extended conversations as the quality is not fantastic.\n\nLiveTrack is the most useful feature. You can configure it to automatically send a link to chosen contacts every time you start an activity, so they can follow your real time location on a map. It’s great for following race progress, but it mostly serves as a tool for someone you trust to know your whereabouts in case something happens. It has generally worked well, though the real location has sometimes lagged when moving in and out of good LTE signal.\n\nView image in fullscreen Sending satellite messages requires that you point your watch in the right direction and face it to an unobstructed view of the sky. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nAll of these features are available on other Garmin watches if you carry your phone with you, but in the places where LTE does not reach, the satellite kicks in on the Fenix 8 Pro to send texts, location check-ins and emergency SOS.\n\nA guide shows you how to find the line of sight to the satellite, which then sends and receives messages within about 10 to 30 seconds. It was surprisingly easy to use and could be a crucial lifeline, though it is important to note that satellite coverage is restricted to the US mainland, most of Canada, and most of Europe except for parts of Scandinavia above 65 degrees north.\n\nSustainability\n\nThe watch is generally repairable with options available via the support site. The battery is rated to maintain at least 90% of its original capacity after two years of weekly charging. The watch does not contain any recycled materials. Garmin offers recycling schemes on new purchases.\n\nPrice\n\nThe Fenix 8 Pro costs from £1,029.99 (€1,199.99/$1,199.99/A$2,299). The optional Garmin inReach subscription plans cost begins from £7.99 (€9.99/$7.99/A$13.50).\n\nVerdict\n\nThe Fenix 8 Pro takes a fantastic adventure watch in the regular Fenix 8 and adds LTE for messaging, calls and LiveTrack – plus satellite messaging, check-in and emergency SOS for when you’re out of signal.\n\nThe result is an even more impressive adventure tool for those that want to be phone-free. If you want to have someone keep an eye on you remotely while running out at night or in the middle of nowhere, the Garmin does so without needing anything else.\n\nIt is quite freeing to be outside without a phone, but that capability comes at quite a cost, both in terms of the colossal price of the watch and the monthly subscription of the inReach plan to provide the service. At least it isn’t dependent on your phone provider so works with any brand of smartphone and network.\n\nThe Fenix 8 Pro is a killer device for someone who hates being weighed down by their phone when running, cycling or hiking, but still wants to be trackable and contactable. For everyone else, it is a lot of money when the excellent Fenix 8 already exists.",

    "text": "It is 20 years since Guitar Hero was launched in North America, and with it, the tools for the everyday gamer to become a rock star. Not literally of course, but try telling that to someone who has nailed Free Bird’s four-minute guitar solo in front of a packed living-room audience.\n\nDeveloped by Harmonix, published by RedOctane and inspired by Konami’s GuitarFreaks, Guitar Hero gave players a guitar-shaped controller with which to match coloured notes scrolling down the screen in time with a song. Each riff or sequence corresponded to specific notes, creating the feel of a genuine performance.\n\nHarmonix had already tried its hand at rhythm games with the PlayStation 2 titles Frequency and Amplitude when it partnered with RedOctane, which was purchased by Activision in 2006. Together they laid the foundations for an unlikely billion-dollar franchise that had a remarkable impact for many of the artists featured, introducing decades-old bands such as Cheap Trick, Kansas and Lynyrd Skynyrd to millions of younger players.\n\nView image in fullscreen Strum-thing new … a line of people playing plastic guitars. Photograph: Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMichael Dornbrook, former COO of Harmonix, recalls the initial financial challenges of licensing the recordings – even though the first two games mostly used cover versions – but also how their bargaining power shifted once the game was a hit.\n\n“We rerecorded all the music because the dollar figure was so high,” he says. “Even with the publishing rights alone, it was nearly impossible. We couldn’t get bands like the Who – RedOctane had virtually no money, and we were pretty convinced it would fail. But once Guitar Hero took off, and record sales and radio play were going up, everyone wanted to be in.”\n\nHe adds: “One of the amazing things was how many parents got in touch and thanked us for introducing their kids to the music they loved. It became a multigenerational thing.”\n\nNorthern Irish blues-rock band the Answer had Never Too Late included on the 2008 game Guitar Hero World Tour. Guitarist Paul Mahon remembers how the series brought classic rock back into vogue: “Guitar Hero offered a bigger, younger audience. Generally this had been seen as music that was past it, but then when it was featured on the game and teenagers were finding it, suddenly it was cool. That legitimised it, and got rid of the ‘dad rock’ tag. It gave all our music a new life.”\n\nIn 2008, the Answer’s debut album was still unreleased in the US, meaning the game was a key medium of discovery for the band as they went on a North American tour supporting AC/DC. “Their crew were playing Never Too Late on the tour bus, and some of them knew us from Guitar Hero,” Mahon says.\n\nView image in fullscreen Spin-off games such as Guitar Hero: Aerosmith were themed around the band. Photograph: ArcadeImages/Alamy\n\nRock’s heavyweight names soon capitalised on the series’ popularity, with Aerosmith, Metallica and Van Halen featuring in dedicated spin-off titles that focused on each band’s catalogue and associated lore, imagery and rock’n’roll mythology. In the case of Guitar Hero: Aerosmith, it was said to have made the band more money than any of their studio albums did. It sold well over half a million copies in its first week, while sales of Aerosmith’s music saw an increase of up to 40% at a time when the music business’s established order was already collapsing in a changing landscape.\n\nThe series continues to inspire nimble-fingered fanaticism among its fans. Earlier this year, streamer CarnyJared completed an impressive attempt of DragonForce’s Through the Fire and Flames – a notoriously difficult power-metal song made popular by Guitar Hero – on Clone Hero, a freeware game with almost identical gameplay but an array of customisation options. This track is challenging enough on expert mode, let alone played at double speed and without missing a single one of its near 4,000 notes. CarnyJared claimed it took nine months of practice.\n\nView image in fullscreen Notoriously difficulty … DragonForce guitarist Herman Li. Photograph: Gary Miller/FilmMagic\n\nA mindboggling feat, but at what point does one pick up an actual guitar? “It doesn’t really matter, because you can’t play [that song] in nine months! There’s zero chance,” says DragonForce guitarist Herman Li, who considers the game world and the real world to be very separate. “Guitar Hero is a fun, fantasy thing. If you play Call of Duty, that doesn’t mean you should pick up a real gun and go to war.”\n\nDragonForce had already wrapped up a successful tour when Through the Fire and Flames was featured on Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock, but Li says it made them a household name. “I remember the record label calling to tell me that we were selling albums like crazy,” he says. “It exploded when we next toured, and we were playing just before the headliners Slipknot and Disturbed on the Mayhem festival.”\n\nIn fact, DragonForce’s exposure from Guitar Hero was so immense that it has threatened to overshadow everything else the band has done. Last year, the song was used in a trailer for Despicable Me 4. “In the past I thought differently, but I’ve made peace with it,” Li says. “If you only listen to one DragonForce song, it’s totally cool – everyone’s got their own musical journey and I’m glad we’ve been part of people’s lives”.\n\nThe best marketing, whether it’s for cars, clothes or video games, goes further than selling something – it evokes a desire. Did Guitar Hero tap into that? “That’s exactly what we were trying to create,” Dornbrook says. “That thrill of being a rock star on the stage. From day one, Alex [Rigopulos] and Eran [Egozy], who co-founded Harmonix, felt that there’s an instinctive human desire to make music, and they wanted to use technology to allow people to do it”.\n\nThe majority of Guitar Hero games were released in just a five-year period between 2005 and 2010, including spin-offs DJ Hero, complete with a turntable controller, and Band Hero, the two games releasing a week apart in 2009: Dornbrook says “Activision is famous for burning out franchises, they tend to overdo it”. After that, the publisher’s interest in plastic instruments died down, aside from a short-lived revival in 2015 with Guitar Hero Live.\n\nGames such as Clone Hero and Fortnite Festival have kept the scene alive, and there’s set to be something from the original publisher on the way: RedOctane Games,, a new studio which has “entered production on its debut rhythm-based title”. Original co-founders Kai and Charles Huang are both involved as special advisers. Is the world ready to embrace another game in the spirit of Guitar Hero?\n\n“We thought those games could be like Madden where you can update every year,” Dornbrook says. “There’s so much new music that it could be evergreen, so I’ve always been optimistic. There’s no reason why it can’t continue with new generations.”",

    "text": "The Senate on Sunday made significant progress towards ending the longest US government shutdown in history, narrowly advancing a compromise bill to reauthorize funding and undo the layoffs of some employees.\n\nBut the measure, which resulted from days of talks between a handful of Democratic and Republican senators, leaves out the healthcare subsidies that Democrats had demanded for weeks. Most Democratic senators rejected it, as did many of the party’s lawmakers in the House of Representatives, which will have to vote to approve it before the government can reopen.\n\n“This healthcare crisis is so severe, so urgent, so devastating for families back home, that I cannot in good faith support this [resolution] that fails to address the healthcare crisis,” said Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate minority leader.\n\nThe bill received exactly the 60 votes needed to advance in the Senate, with almost all Republicans voting in favor along with eight members of the Democratic caucus, many of whom are moderates or serving their final terms.\n\n“Republicans control the White House, the Senate and the House, and they made clear over a period of weeks, including just this week, that this was as far as they would go as part of the shutdown talks,” said New Hampshire’s Jeanne Shaheen, a member of the group who is retiring after next year.\n\n“This was the only deal on the table.”\n\nBeside Shaheen, the Democratic senators who voted in favor on Sunday were Tim Kaine of Virginia, Dick Durbin of Illinois, John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, Jacky Rosen of Nevada and Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with the party.\n\nIn the 40 days since the shutdown began when the government’s funding authorization expired on 1 October, the Senate’s Republican leader, John Thune, held 14 votes on a bill approved on a near party line vote by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, which would have extended funding through most of November.\n\nBut no more than three Democrats ever voted in the affirmative, denying it the support it needed to proceed. The minority party demanded that any funding legislation also extend tax credits that lower premiums for Affordable Care Act health plans, which were created under Joe Biden and expire at the end of the year.\n\nThune maintained that he would be willing to negotiate over those subsidies, but only once the government was reopened.\n\n“After 40 long days, I’m hopeful we can bring this shutdown to the end,” he said shortly before the vote was held on Sunday evening.\n\n“From the precarious situation we’re in with air travel to the fact that our staff have been working without pay for a full 40 days now, all of us, Republicans and Democrats who support this bill know that the time to act is now.”\n\nThe compromise legislation authorizes government funding through 30 January 2026 and undoes the firings of federal workers that the White House carried out after the shutdown began. It also guarantees retroactive pay for furloughed federal workers and those who stayed on the job during the shutdown, and prevents further layoffs through January. Included in the compromise are three appropriations bill that will authorize spending through the 2026 fiscal year for the departments of agriculture and veterans affairs, among others.\n\nThe compromise does not resolve the issue of the Affordable Care Act premiums, which one study forecast would jump by an average of 26% if the tax credits were allowed to expire.\n\nAs part of the deal, Thune said he would allow a vote on a bill to deal with the credits by the second week of December. But even if it succeeds, the Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, has said he will not put such a measure on the floor.\n\nThe compromise bill will now need to be approved by the House and signed by Donald Trump, which may take days. After advancing the legislation, the Senate adjourned until Monday morning, leaving the timing of further voting on the matter up in the air.\n\nJohnson has kept the House out of session since 19 September, in an effort to force Senate Democrats to vote for the GOP spending bill. Shortly after the Senate’s procedural vote on the compromise succeeded, the House told lawmakers to expect votes this week.\n\nBut all signs point to a stormy reception for the bill in the chamber, particularly among Democrats.\n\n“America is far too expensive. We will not support spending legislation advanced by Senate Republicans that fails to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits,” the Democratic House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, said. We will fight the GOP bill in the House of Representatives, where Mike Johnson will be compelled to end the seven-week Republican taxpayer-funded vacation.”\n\nGreg Casar, chair of the Congressional Progressive caucus, said: “A deal that doesn’t reduce healthcare costs is a betrayal of millions of Americans counting on Democrats to fight for them. Republicans want healthcare cuts. Accepting nothing but a pinky promise from Republicans isn’t a compromise – it’s capitulation.”\n\nJust before the Senate voted, the Democratic congressman Ro Khanna called for Schumer to “be replaced”, saying he was “no longer effective”. “If you can’t lead the fight to stop healthcare premiums from skyrocketing for Americans, what will you fight for?”\n\nRelegated to the minority in both chambers of Congress by voters after last year’s elections, Democrats seized on the lapse in government funding to make a stand on healthcare, long a signature issue of the party.\n\nIn the more than five weeks that followed, polls showed the public believe the GOP was more to blame for the shutdown than the Democrats, and last Tuesday, the party swept off-year elections, in what Democratic leaders called a validation of their strategy in the funding fight.\n\nThe weeks of unfunded government have taken a toll across the United States. More than 700,000 federal workers were furloughed, and hundreds of thousands more made to work without pay, leading to increasingly long lines at food banks and other social services nationwide as the missed paychecks piled up.\n\nAt the start of November, the Trump administration moved to pause payments from the federal government’s largest food aid program for the first time ever, prompting an ongoing court fight.\n\nThe transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, last week ordered a nationwide reduction in commercial air travel, saying air traffic controllers were facing unprecedented strain. More than 2,500 flights were canceled on Sunday, and Duffy said capacity would be slashed further on Tuesday if funding was not restored.",

    "text": "A rainbow of vapes and Apple-branded products light up the window of a south London shop as a small army of police prepare to march through the door.\n\nOfficers have been watching the shop for months and have already carried out tests in independent labs on products bought there. Most have come back with a high risk rate for possible electrocution and fires.\n\nMany of the products are illegal, after a law passed in June banned the sale of single-use vapes, a move designed to combat environmental damage and their widespread use by children.\n\nThe shop is one of six electrical goods outlets, all within a short distance of each other in Lambeth, being targeted by a team of about 80 people from the Metropolitan police, HM Revenue and Customs, the local authority and Trading Standards.\n\nThe raids are part of Operation Machinize 2, a nationwide crackdown on high street crime, targeting cash intensive businesses in the “grey economy” that police believe are linked to money laundering.\n\nThe National Crime Agency, the body responsible for fighting serious and organised crime, helped plan the raids of more than 2,700 premises, leading to 924 arrests.\n\nPolice seized more than £10.7m of suspected illegal proceeds, 111,000 illegal vapes, 70kg of cannabis and 4.5m illegal cigarettes.\n\nView image in fullscreen Vapes for sale in the shop in south London. Photograph: Jill Mead/The Guardian\n\nThe walls of the south London shop appear to be lined with Apple products – though the trademark representative and police officers quickly spot that the serial numbers on each box, which should be individual to each item, are all identical. It is a clear giveaway that the products are counterfeit.\n\nInspector Oliver Lamb, who has worked for the force for more than 12 years, is overseeing the operation in Lambeth.\n\n“It’s not the first time we have been to some of these shops – for some it’s been the third visit this year,” Lamb says. In the past the police have raided shops, only to find later that the managers have simply restocked their shelves with the same products after they have left.\n\n“Originally we thought that removal of the stock would be a significant enough message to the retailers, and to explain to them you can’t do this, and why you can’t do this, and you’re going to lose it soon.\n\n“When we came [here] earlier this year we seized £18,200 worth of Apple products alone, and that doesn’t include the vapes which were probably equal in volume. So it didn’t disrupt them – I thought it would prevent it and it didn’t.”\n\nCompanies House documents show that the small shop is connected to multiple companies – including one that is now dissolved under the name of the current proprietor.\n\nAs police rifle through his stock he protests at various points that the products are genuine, arguing with a trademark representative from Apple who has accompanied the police. Still, the police end up filling evidence bags with Apple-branded AirPods, chargers and cables, all of which appear to be counterfeit, as well as bags of disposable vapes.\n\nPolice say the shops are often used to hide other illegal stores in secret rooms, and so officials search for hidden compartments under the counter. No rooms are found, though the officers end up seizing more than £3,000 worth in cash from the till.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Haven’t you got anything better to do?”\n\nView image in fullscreen Police check phone cases on the wall. Photograph: Jill Mead/The Guardian\n\nOthers seem unperturbed: a woman eats her lunch at the next counter while the police question another business owner in the complex. Several customers continue to come into the store to buy products from the business, including a vape.\n\nBut Lamb insists the presence of the shops are a source of public frustration, not to mention a risk to public health. By the end of the raid the police have spoken to witnesses at a big retailer nearby who say they regularly see the shop selling disposable vapes to children.\n\n“[Counterfeit goods] are a source of public frustration. They buy the product, they find it’s fake and then they’ve got no consumer rights,” says Lamb. “We’ve got chargers, watches, counterfeit Apple goods and AirPods by the bag load, as well as counterfeit vapes, which is quite concerning as we’ve got no idea what people are inhaling from it.\n\n“Success is shutting these businesses down and making way for legitimate ones.”\n\nOfficers say Machinize 2 is the largest operation of its kind focusing on the grey economy. An estimated £2.7m of illicit goods have been destroyed as a result of the raids, and more than 450 businesses reported to Companies House for further investigation.\n\n“Depriving criminals of their source of income has a real impact, limiting the amount of funds they can reinvest in further offending and deterring them from taking spaces on our high street that could be used by legitimate businesses,” says Rachael Herbert, the director of the NCA’s national economic crime centre.",

    "text": "Retailers suffered the slowest sales growth since May last month as shoppers were cautious in the run-up to expected budget tax rises and held out for Black Friday discounts.\n\nSales rose 1.6% in October, a step down from 2.3% the month before, according to the latest figures from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) trade body and the advisory group KPMG.\n\nFood sales growth posted the biggest slowdown, by 0.8 percentage points to 3.5%, as confidence dipped, inflation eased, and shoppers began to save for the festive season.\n\nNon-food sales were virtually flat year on year, at 0.1%, as sales of footwear, stationery and appliances fell amid milder weather and expectations of deals around the US-inspired Black Friday discount day on 28 November.\n\nSeparate figures from Barclays suggest a third of consumers were holding off on big purchases last month to wait until after the budget, with two in five adjusting their finances accordingly.\n\nThe bank said it was the first time that all seven of the measures of consumer and economic confidence it tracks had fallen since August 2022.\n\nConfidence in household finances fell most significantly, from 74% to 63%, Barclays found. The proportion of those confident in their job security and ability to spend on non-essential items reached their lowest points since 2023 – at 44% and 51%.\n\nBarclays said spending on its credit and debit cards fell 0.8% in October, a similar level to the 0.7% in September, with some of the biggest drops in supermarkets, department stores and discounters, while spending on electronics, fuel and motoring dived.\n\nRetailers, including Argos and the Sainsbury’s boss Simon Roberts, have expressed concern that Rachel Reeves is due to announce her tax and spending plans a couple of days before the Black Friday promotional bonanza, which has become one of the biggest spending days of the year.\n\nHelen Dickinson, the chief executive of the BRC, said: “Retailers are counting on Black Friday to deliver a vital boost, but looming budget decisions risk undermining fragile consumer confidence.”\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Many delayed spending, waiting for Black Friday deals and cooler temperatures before buying toys, electronics and clothing. Furniture and other homeware fared better as people began preparing their homes ahead of family festive gatherings.”\n\nShe said food sales growth was “mostly driven by higher prices rather than higher volumes”.\n\nSarah Bradbury, the chief executive of the grocery trade body IGD, said shoppers were keeping a tight rein on the grocery spending: “Confidence has dipped, with shoppers prioritising saving money over quality for the first time this year. The news of potential tax rises will concern many shoppers, even as food price inflation eased somewhat.\n\n“With the job market stalling and the gap between pay growth and price rises narrowing, overall shoppers aren’t feeling much benefit. Looking ahead, we predict shoppers will be extra cautious in the short term to ensure they can afford to treat themselves at Christmas.”",

Photograph: Joe Giddens/PA\n\nA dispiriting trading update had sent the shares to a 10-year low, another unwanted milestone in the grim slog of Diageo’s post-pandemic journey.\n\nA hoped-for “roaring twenties” rebound failed to materialise, not just in pubs and bars but in the wider economy, as discretionary spending fell victim to the cost of living crisis.\n\nThere have been strategic missteps too, resulting in the ousting over the summer of Lewis’s predecessor, Debra Crew, who was appointed after the untimely death of the Diageo legend Ivan Menezes.\n\nHer tenure had been marked by a shock profits warning caused by a supply problem in Latin America that caught Diageo’s management napping.\n\nIn the run-up to Christmas last year, Diageo appeared to have misjudged its supply chain again, with UK pubs complaining that their flow of Guinness had been rationed.\n\nRumours swirled that Crew, a former captain in US military intelligence, might pull out the big guns. Potential strategic bazookas included an £8bn sale of the Guinness brand or Diageo’s 34% stake in the champagne and cognac business Moët Hennessy.\n\nDiageo insiders are understood to have admired Crew’s grasp on what needed fixing but felt she lacked the bold strategic vision to steer the company out of the doldrums, let alone the ability to convince the City that she could.\n\nUnderlying the strategic concerns were long-term trends, such as declining drinking rates, particularly among younger people.\n\nLast August, Fundsmith, the investment management company run by the City veteran Terry Smith, sold its holding in Diageo, a stake it had held since 2010.\n\nSmith highlighted the rise of weight-loss drugs such as Wegovy. These, he said, had shown signs of effectiveness in helping people cut down on their drinking, threatening global booze sales in perpetuity.\n\nDrastic times called for “Drastic Dave”.\n\nLewis earned that moniker during nearly three decades at the consumer juggernaut Unilever and cemented it at Tesco.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Dado Ruvić/Reuters\n\nJavier Gonzalez Lastra, the head of European beverages research at Berenberg, hailed a “tremendous step”, predicting that Lewis would overhaul Diageo’s culture at speed.\n\nBut what drastic measures could drastic Dave pull out of his Tesco shopping bag?\n\nAJ Bell thinks Lewis could revive the Guinness sale talk, something Diageo strenuously denied having given serious consideration to earlier this summer.\n\nA less drastic option could involve a fire sale of some of Diageo’s stable of about 200 brands, increasing profit margins and ensuring the company’s mammoth marketing budget, of about £2.7bn a year, is more tightly focused on the best-performing labels.\n\nDespite its woes, Diageo has so far managed to avoid cutting its dividend. Chris Beckett, a consumer staples analyst at Quilter Cheviot, thinks Lewis would have licence to rip off the plaster, incurring more short-term pain for the share price, for long-term gain.\n\nBeckett pointed out that curbing the shareholder payout was one of Lewis’s first acts when he took over at Tesco in 2014, “whether you call it ‘kitchen sinking’ or simply accepting the reality of an overleveraged balance sheet”.\n\nBut macroeconomic challenges will remain.\n\nConsumer confidence remains brittle worldwide, while Donald Trump’s tariffs continue to cast a pall over consumer goods. Over the longer term, questions remain over whether the impact of weight-loss drugs – and the sobriety of generation Z – are cyclical trends or the new normal.\n\nSome things even Drastic Dave cannot fix.",

    "text": "The UK is to investigate whether hundreds of Chinese-made buses can be controlled remotely by their manufacturer, amid increasing concerns over Beijing’s involvement in British infrastructure.\n\nThe Department for Transport and the National Cyber Security Centre are examining whether buses made by Yutong could be vulnerable to interference.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department for Transport said: “We are looking into the case and working closely with the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre to understand the technical basis for the actions taken by the Norwegian and Danish authorities.\n\n“The department takes security issues extremely seriously and works closely with the intelligence community to understand and mitigate potential risks.”\n\nYutong began as the Zhengzhou Bus Repair Factory in 1963 in the Central China province of Henan. It says it has exported nearly 110,000 buses to more than 100 countries, capturing more than 10% of the global market.\n\nIn the UK, its buses are used in Bristol, Essex, Leicester, Nottingham, south Wales and South Yorkshire, among other locations.\n\nHowever, an investigation in Norway by Oslo’s public transport service, Ruter, found that Yutong buses could theoretically be “stopped or rendered inoperable” by the manufacturer. Denmark also opened an investigation after the Norwegian findings.\n\nRuter did not say there was any evidence that Yutong had tried to control the buses, and said it would impose “even stricter security requirements in future procurements”. It also said that the buses’ cameras were not connected to the internet, and “there is no risk of image or video transmission from the buses”.\n\nAny evidence that a Chinese manufacturer had interfered with bus or car operations would probably have a devastating impact on vehicle exports, a key industrial aim for China’s government.\n\nNevertheless, digital security experts have warned for years that over-the-air updates to cars could be a security or privacy threat, either for a hostile state or criminal groups.\n\nRuter said it had tested two buses from Yutong and Dutch manufacturer VDL in a facility inside a mountain tunnel – a measure that would prevent remote tampering during tests. Yutong’s buses are capable of over-the-air software updates, meaning that the manufacturer has the ability to change software.\n\nRuter said: “There is access to the control system for battery and power supply via mobile network through a Romanian sim card. In theory, therefore, this bus can be stopped or rendered inoperable by the manufacturer.”\n\nOver-the-air updates are a common feature of modern vehicles, including many mid-range cars made in the UK, US, Europe and China. With slick digital interfaces increasingly becoming one of the most important attractions for buyers, manufacturers and drivers value the ability to access the latest software.\n\nYutong did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company previously told the Sunday Times that it “strictly complies with the applicable laws, regulations and industry standards of the locations where its vehicles operate”.",

    "text": "Rachel Reeves is planning to remove the two-child benefit cap in full in the November budget, in a move that could cost more than £3bn but lift 350,000 children out of poverty.\n\nThe chancellor is understood to be preparing to reverse the Conservative measure entirely, having originally looked at ways to taper it either for very large families or richer ones.\n\nReeves is acting after the prime minister, Keir Starmer, insisted that Labour should go into the next election having reduced child poverty. But the chancellor is also hoping removing the cap, which is popular with voters but deeply unpopular among Labour MPs, will placate many in her party who are concerned about the political consequences of a possible rise in income tax.\n\nThe chancellor told BBC Radio 5 Live on Monday: “I don’t think we can lose sight of the costs to our economy in allowing child poverty to go unchecked. In the end, a child should not be penalised because their parents don’t have very much money.”\n\nShe added: “In many cases you might have a mum and dad who were both in work, but perhaps one of them has developed a chronic illness or one of them has passed away.\n\n“There are plenty of reasons why people make decisions to have three, four children, but then find themselves in difficult times. But also you have things like adoption, or foster caring – lots and lots of different reasons why families change shape and size over time.\n\n“I don’t think that it’s right that a child is penalised because they are in a bigger family, through no fault of their own.”\n\nAllies of the chancellor said her words should be taken as a signal of intent that she wanted to remove the cap in full rather than only in part.\n\nReeves’s comments show how far she has come since the last election, when she and Starmer decided not to include a promise to remove the cap in the party’s manifesto, arguing they could not afford “unfunded promises”. The Resolution Foundation has estimated that removing the cap in full would cost about £3.5bn by 2029-30.\n\nStarmer continued to defend that position after entering government, even suspending seven MPs last year for voting for a Scottish National party motion calling for an end to the cap.\n\nIn the wake of that rebellion, Starmer commissioned the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, to lead a taskforce to make recommendations on how to reduce child poverty.\n\nPhillipson is due to publish her findings around the time of the budget, and is understood to have concluded that fully abolishing the cap is the best way to remove the maximum number of children from poverty.\n\nAllies of the prime minister insist he has always wanted to remove the cap in full as soon as possible. One said: “Keir has always said he wants to drive down child poverty in government. It would mortify him if it went up on his watch.\n\n“He’s adamant that it will dwarf what Blair did to reduce child poverty in government. It really matters to him; it’s something he’s talked about for years. He wants to be able to go into the next election saying that if you vote for Labour you’ll take more children out of poverty.”\n\nAlison Garnham, the chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, said: “The two-child limit is the biggest driver of rising child poverty in the UK and scrapping it in full is the right thing to do. All children are equally deserving of a good childhood and abolishing this cruel policy would give millions more kids a better start in life.”\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Headlines UK Free newsletter Get the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And as a result, we’ve never managed to get our productivity back to where it was before the financial crisis.”\n\nReeves has been considering a plan to raise income tax rates by 2p and cut national insurance by 2p – a move that would raise £6bn and protect most workers while hitting pensioners and landlords.\n\nReports suggest, however, she is thinking of limiting the national insurance cuts to those earning about £50,000 and less, which would mean a significant tax rise for the top 25% of earners.",

    "text": "The black horse of Lloyds’ banks is a familiar sight on UK high streets, but the lender has quietly become one of the country’s biggest landlords, too, amassing £2bn in residential property, according to analysis.\n\nThe company has reached the landmark valuation on its property assets after a drive to buy more than 7,000 properties, in news first reported by the Financial Times.\n\nAlready the UK’s largest mortgage lender, it set out ambitious plans four years ago to acquire 50,000 rental homes by 2030 to become the country’s biggest landlord.\n\nIt launched its Lloyds Living division in July 2021, then called Citra Living, which provides homes for rent and shared ownership at 42 developments across the country. They are a mix of houses and low-rise apartment blocks, usually located in suburban areas, rather than city centres.\n\nLloyds Living now manages 7,500 homes, “from one-bedroom apartments for young professionals to four-bedroom houses for growing families”. This puts it among the UK’s biggest private sector landlords, which include the insurance and pension group Legal & General, the fund manager M&G and the property developer Grainger.\n\nA spokesperson for the bank said: “We are pleased with the significant progress made to grow the Lloyds Living business since its launch in 2021, and how – in line with the strategic aims set out from the start – it is helping to increase access to good quality, affordable housing nationwide and is already contributing significantly to the group’s diversified income streams.”\n\nLloyds said most of its acquisition activity has been funding its development partners to build more housing.\n\nIn June, the bank struck its second big property deal with Barratt Redrow, the UK’s largest housebuilder, as part of the companies’ build-to-rent partnership. It added 598 two-, three- and four-bedroom homes in 11 new and existing Lloyds Living sites including Berkshire, Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Kent, Cheshire and Gloucestershire.\n\nLast summer, Lloyds started turning former office buildings into social homes at a site in Pudsey in West Yorkshire, with plans for 93 homes to be rented at half the usual rate, making it the first UK bank to enter the social housing market directly.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Lloyds chief executive, Charlie Nunn, cautioned then that “the challenge is considerable and complex”, but added that there were “countless brownfield sites that lie empty”.\n\nDiversifying away from lending into private home rentals means Lloyds is less reliant on interest income, which was squeezed in recent years by record low UK interest rates.\n\nLloyds has reported “strong income growth” from Lloyds Living. However, its performance has been overshadowed by the ongoing car loans commission scandal. The lender is also the UK’s biggest car lender through its Black Horse division and is expected to foot the largest bill compensation bill for the scandal among its peers.",

Andy Dinsdale, the founder of the plastic pollution campaign group Strandliners, said it was the worst pollution event he had seen.\n\nAccording to Southern Water, the spill was caused by a mechanical failure at its Eastbourne sewage works. The beads are used in the last step of the cleaning process before treated effluent water is released back into rivers or the sea.\n\nA spokesperson said: “After completing the initial stages of a thorough investigation, which is continuing, we believe it is highly likely that the beads have come from our Eastbourne wastewater treatment works.\n\nView image in fullscreen Volunteers at work at Camber Sands. Photograph: Sarah Tilotta/Getty Images\n\n“We’ve identified a failure of a screening filter, which has apparently led to beads used in the treatment process being released into the sea during heavy rainfall. The screen should have prevented this occurring.\n\n“We are very sorry this has happened and are doing everything possible to investigate and resolve the problem.”\n\nThe company said it would provide further updates when more information became available.\n\n“Southern Water teams continue to work closely with Rother district council, which is leading the cleanup efforts, and we remain committed to supporting this work in every way we can,” it added.\n\nView image in fullscreen A dead seal at Camber Sands. The animal’s death is not believed to be directly related to the spill but authorities have expressed concern over the impact on marine life in the area. Photograph: Sarah Tilotta/Getty Images\n\n“Southern Water volunteers will continue to assist. Our staff are there to help, and we ask that they are treated with respect as they help with the beach clean.”\n\nIt is unclear whether the company will face punishment for the spill, such as a fine.\n\nCamber Sands in East Sussex is one of England’s most beloved beaches, with rare dune habitat and vast stretches of golden sand. It is home to dolphins, porpoises, seals and seabirds including terns and cormorants.\n\nThese beads contain a high number of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which have been linked to cancer. They often contain toxins including lead, antimony and bromine. Once in the sea, they attract algae, which makes them smell like food to sea creatures, which then eat them and can be poisoned.\n\nHelena Dollimore, the Labour and Co-operative MP for Hastings and Rye, said: “Southern Water now admits the toxic plastic beads on Camber Sands were released two weeks ago from their Eastbourne treatment plant during Storm Benjamin. It beggars belief that Southern Water failed to detect the loss of millions of biobeads for an entire fortnight, leaving them free to wash up on our East Sussex coastline and cause an environmental catastrophe.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Down to Earth Free weekly newsletter The planet's most important stories.

Photograph: Strandliners\n\n“So why did it take our community to uncover the truth? When I inquired about these biobeads on Friday, Southern Water flatly denied involvement. There must be an independent investigation into how this spill went undetected for so long and why a company with such a long record of environmental negligence once again failed to act responsibly. Southern Water cannot be trusted to mark their own homework.”\n\nDollimore said the company should urgently deploy every possible resource to clean the coastline. “Instead of paying dividends or bonuses, they must pay for a full programme of nature recovery to restore the fragile ecosystems at Camber Sands, Rye and Hastings, and along our coastline – ecosystems that their negligence has put at serious risk,” she added.\n\nThe water minister, Emma Hardy, said she had spoken to the chief executive of Southern Water on Monday. “I am deeply disappointed about the plastic pollution incident affecting Camber Sands, East Sussex. It is right that Southern Water has taken responsibility,” Hardy said.\n\n“The immediate priority now needs to be addressing any environmental damage and minimising further impacts. I am in close touch with the Environment Agency, who are conducting a thorough investigation, looking at what regulatory action should be taken and working with Rother district council on the cleanup operation.”\n\nAn Environment Agency spokesperson said: “We acknowledge that Southern Water has admitted responsibility for the pollution incident in a statement released this morning. This is an active investigation and we will not hesitate to take robust enforcement action where appropriate.\n\n“We continue to work closely with Rother district council and other responders on the clean-up operation of plastic pellets on Camber Sands, East Sussex. The lead for this activity continues to be the district council and we remain ready to help should they need it.”\n\nPeople in Sussex have reported a number of dead stranded seals and a porpoise in recent days, and fear the deaths could be linked to the beads.\n\nVolunteers have spent days trying in vain to rid the beach of the tiny beads, which, if left in the environment, will break down into microplastics that are almost impossible to extract from the sea and food chain.\n\nLocals have been using rakes and dustpans and brushes to remove the beads.",

    "text": "There are less than three weeks to go. In the lengthy wait for Rachel Reeves’s autumn budget, the chancellor will on Monday get the first verdict on her tax and spending plans from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR).\n\nAfter the interminable weeks of speculation, kite flying and bad headlines, this moment matters. Has the widely anticipated fiscal gap of up to £30bn been filled? At what cost for growth, inflation, and living standards?\n\nHeading into this moment the chancellor can take some heart. Gilt markets have rallied in recent weeks, bringing down the cost of government borrowing. What the OBR thinks is one thing. But the bond market is the intimidator-in-chief of governments the world over.\n\nThe backdrop in global markets has helped in recent weeks. Falling US borrowing costs are a tailwind. Reeves has also succeeded in rolling the pitch for jittery investors in UK government debt by talking up her commitment to fiscal discipline. The negative space framing the chancellor’s otherwise vacuous speech last week was the acknowledgment that taxes will rise, spending could be cut.\n\nKeeping the bond market on side is important. There are plenty of voices arguing the dangers are overplayed. But Reeves is right to say there is “nothing progressive, nothing Labour” about risking a bond market reaction that would drive up borrowing costs. However, there is a fine line to tread. Bending to the bond market view is no risk-free bet.\n\nIn the City, investors are looking for Reeves to be tough on public spending in particular. Doing so would send out the strongest message of budget discipline to the bond market – far more than a manifesto-busting round of tax hikes.\n\nAs debt market analysts at Barclays put it last month: “Spending reform is now seen as a totemic issue by the market.” That Keir Starmer’s government foundered in its attempt to cut £5bn from welfare earlier this year was “a red flag from the perspective of the gilt market,” they said.\n\nAt the same time, bond investors worry big tax increases could torpedo Britain’s growth prospects. Doing so would lock the country in a debt-laden, low-growth doom loop.\n\n“The gilt market can see the more you’re sticking up taxes, the more that you’re trashing growth,” says Mark Dowding, the chief investment officer at the hedge fund RBC BlueBay. He would rather Reeves prevent a “culture of benefits dependency” from taking root by cutting welfare.\n\n“The tax burden is already historically high, and if spending continues to move on an upwards trajectory, you’re almost saying that taxes will need to continue to increase. That doesn’t feel sustainable.”\n\nReeves will need to be alive to the risk that tax rises could hit growth – the government’s No 1 mission. The Bank of England could take some of the slack by cutting rates. But it is a gamble. A slowdown would sap tax receipts, living standards. Efforts to balance the books and Labour’s re-election chances would take a serious knock.\n\nHowever, the welfare-cutting bias in the City is simplistic, misplaced, and could condemn Britain to a worse trajectory.”\n\nCutting welfare might sound an attractive cost saver. Total spending in cash terms is rising at a dramatic rate: from roughly £300bn to about £370bn by the end of the decade – largely as a result of the pensions triple lock and rising disability and health-related benefit caseloads.\n\nBritain is an ageing and increasingly unwell nation, fuelled not just by simple demographic changes; but also an underperforming economy and crumbling public services. A fifth of the population is of retirement age, and as life expectancy increases and the baby boomer generation reaches older age, these changes will only accelerate. The welfare bill is a reflection of this.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Pensioners get most of the money, with 13.1 million recipients. Much of the rest goes to 10 million working-age adults, most through universal credit – where more than a third of claimants are in work.\n\nDespite these pressures, total welfare spending is projected to remain flat as a percentage of GDP up to the end of the decade. Tell this to the next person who says welfare spending is on an unsustainable path but holding the defence budget constant as a share of national income is a disaster.\n\nFor all of the pressure on the state, overall working-age welfare spending is flat and similar to the levels in 2015. Cash spending on health-related benefits is rising, but as a share of GDP it is lower now than in the 1990s.\n\nWhen push comes to shove, welfare cuts affect more people than might be immediately imagined in the othering narratives about welfare scroungers. Evidence shows health-related benefit cuts would drive up poverty, not employment. Meanwhile, taking money out of the pockets of vulnerable people would reduce spending in the economy. Raising taxes is not the only way to slow an economy to stall speed.\n\nIncreasingly, there is recognition that Britain’s economic prospects have been undermined by the erosion of the country’s social safety net.\n\nThe debate at the last election was centred on boosting growth to fund public services and the welfare state. But this negates the point that the relationship between the two is symbiotic. The last decade and a half of austerity is proof enough.",

    "text": "Martin Kettle highlights the political importance of the upcoming budget and the difficulties facing Rachel Reeves as the Labour government considers the prospect of having to increase income tax (Rachel Reeves is damned if she raises income tax in the budget – and damned if she doesn’t, 6 November).\n\nIf Labour gets punished at the next election, it may not be because of a single broken electoral promise; it will more likely be because the electorate does not trust that there is a coherent, effective plan for governing.\n\nI’m not convinced that in the UK we have any greater tendency to “possessive individualism” today, despite Thatcher’s declaration in 1987 that “there is no such thing as society”. That said, I’m sure many would accept the need to contribute more to the collective good if the government was clearer about its plans, demonstrated a willingness to stick to the task in hand, and adopted a more considered approach to the allocation of public money.\n\nIn terms of mitigating the fallout from tax rises, it’s possible that the government might receive a better response if it were to focus more on clarity of purpose and the collective benefits of well-funded public services, rather than relying on divisive catchphrases such as, “those with the broadest shoulders should pay their fair share”.\n\nProf Stephen Caddick\n\nWorthing, West Sussex\n\nMartin Kettle fails to mention two other long-lasting impacts of Thatcherism. During my time as deputy leader of the Labour group at Cambridgeshire county council, from 1985 to 1989, we faced an attack on local government, a punitive approach to local decision-making and, in the end, the removal of autonomy over setting the business rate. For every extra £1 we wished to spend, we were “fined” £3 in lost grant, so had to raise the rates by £4 to spend an extra £1.\n\nSecond, the privatisation of directly provided services, which moved a whole generation of public servants committed to serving the common good into the private sector to be “wealth creating” entrepreneurs.\n\nI was fortunate to work alongside a development corporation committed to serving the common good, which, between 1970 and 1988, built 26,306 houses, of which 15,312 (58%), were social housing.\n\nBrian Keegan\n\nPeterborough\n\nThe media obsession with Labour preparing to “break manifesto promises” is infantile (Rachel Reeves refuses to rule out tax rises as autumn budget looms, 4 November). It is contemptuous of the voting public, much like a five-year-old who screams “but you promised” when their mum, having promised to take the child to the park, decided not to because it started to rain. The government should be commended for being flexible enough to change course, if only to mitigate the upheavals brought about by the current US administration.\n\nFawzi Ibrahim\n\nLondon\n\nIf the chancellor wants to reduce household energy bills for the less well off (Reeves considers cut to green levies in effort to reduce cost of energy bills, 4 November), there is a simple way to do it. Abolish daily standing charges and bundle infrastructure costs into the usage charges. Then those who economise by using little or no energy will pay less, average users will pay much the same, and lavish users will pay just a small percentage more.\n\nNick Floyer\n\nChiswick, London",

    "text": "Magical thinking is indispensable to understanding Team Trump’s economic policymaking. The White House often seems to believe two opposing policies can work together while one policy can do two or three contradictory things.\n\nA heavy dose of hocus pocus will be needed to make the administration’s dollar policy work in the interest of the United States, for it appears that they want to end the US dollar’s supremacy in global finance.\n\nAt least some part of it does. True, Donald Trump has warned countries not to replace the dollar, or else. And, reportedly, some members of the administration want to encourage more countries to adopt the dollar outright. But what is also true is that Stephen Miran, the president’s chief economic adviser, on leave to act as board member of the Federal Reserve, thinks the dollar’s position as the main reserve currency of the world is an undue burden for the US and a principal driver of the large trade deficit that Trump finds so odious.\n\n“America runs large current account deficits not because it imports too much,” Miran wrote last year. Rather, it imports too much because it must export Treasury bonds to provide other countries with assets in which to park their reserves. This leads to “persistent dollar overvaluation that prevents the balancing of international trade.”\n\nThe quote brings to mind Jenny Holzer’s 1980s Times Square billboard, with its dry appeal to a higher power: “protect me from what I want.”\n\nIt is not impossible that Trump & Co. could effectively debase the dollar. They could do it through policy choice or sheer incompetence. Arguably, they have already started. They will not like the outcome.\n\nFor sure, foreign countries will suffer if US Treasury bonds quit their job as safe liquid assets in which to park reserves. There are no good alternatives out there. The old hope that the euro would rival the dollar has been stymied by Europe’s fragmented capital markets. A quarter century from the euro’s launch there is no euro T-bond. The renminbi, meanwhile, can’t play a leading role in global finance while China retains capital controls that keep money from freely flowing in and out.\n\nThe dollar is valuable not only as a financial haven. A recent research paper points out that roughly two thirds of countries in the world stabilize their currency against the dollar to provide insurance against global economic shocks. Because the US market is so large, the value of the dollar affects the price of traded goods: shocks that appreciate the dollar also raise their price. Holding dollars or, indeed, aligning one’s currency with the dollar – can help hedge against these economic fluctuations.\n\nThe cost of undermining the dollar to the US would also be enormous. For starters, it stands to lose world influence, alongside its main tool for economic coercion, which allows it to limit enemies’ access to the financial system. Moreover, the US would relinquish what former French president Valery Giscard d’Estaing called the US’s “exorbitant privilege”.\n\nMiran is not wrong that the dollar’s reserve status draws a lot of money into Treasury bonds. But that is a gift. It allows the government to fund its massive debt – 120% of GDP – at a low interest rate. The privilege also implies that the US earns more on its holdings of foreign assets than foreigners earn on their US holdings. Indeed, curbing the US current account deficit would be much more difficult if the US lost its reserve status because its interest rate edge would shrink or disappear altogether.\n\nWhich brings us to the question, will Trump knock the dollar off its perch? Its supremacy has been eroding. These days it accounts for 58% of global foreign exchange reserves, down from 74% at the turn of the century. The interest rate advantage Treasury bonds have over the debt of corporations or other countries has shrunk over time.\n\nAnd Trump’s trade war will reduce the dollar’s insurance powers. By curbing US imports, Trump’s tariff wall will dampen the relationship between the dollar and the price of traded goods–reducing its value as a hedge against economic shocks. “We’re basically reducing the impact that we have on the world market, and by reducing the impact that we have on the world market, we also reduce the dollar safety property,” notes Tarek Hassan of Boston University.\n\nAnd that gives countries and investors less of a reason to peg their currency to the greenback or hold dollar assets. Hassan estimates that the tariffs imposed so far have raised US interest rates by half a percentage point, a not-irrelevant amount given that rates are in the 3-4% range. Developing countries have been swapping out of dollar debt in recent months, turning to currencies with lower interest rates like the Swiss franc and the renminbi.\n\nThe notion that the president’s trade war might undermine the dollar’s pre-eminence struck hard on “Liberation Day” in April when Trump first announced his round-robin “reciprocal” tariffs. US stocks, bonds and the dollar plunged in unison, like risky emerging market assets, breaking the ironclad rule of modern finance that shocks to the system, whether coming from the US or some faraway developing country, benefit Treasury bonds and the dollar as the world’s safe haven, where governments, investors and regular people park money in times of unrest.\n\nMarkets have calmed down since then. Investors appear to have forgiven Trump for the incoherent policymaking. Maybe it’s because Trump ultimately walked back many of the tariffs. But blood is in the water. The odds that the Treasury bond will lose its primacy as the world’s safest asset are looking shorter.\n\nWho knows what that would entail? Other currencies might fill some of the slack. Europe’s joint effort to rearm, for instance, could open an opportunity for euro-wide bonds to rival US Treasury bonds in other countries’ foreign exchange reserves. But insurance against economic and financial shocks will likely become more expensive. Global welfare will surely suffer.\n\nTrump & Co might at first applaud a cheaper dollar, which would likely translate into a smaller US trade deficit. The cheers, however, are unlikely to last. This would come, for the US, at an exorbitant cost.",

    "text": "In port, the 80,000-tonne Fujian aircraft carrier would be impossible to miss. More than 300 metres long and capable of carrying about 60 aircraft, the £5.4bn super-vessel places China second among the world’s navies, with three aircraft carriers, though still a long way behind the global leader, the US, which has 11.\n\nYet for all the great power projection of the new warship, nearly 5,000 miles away from its home port another conflict appears to suggest size may not matter. In the Black Sea, Ukraine achieved an extraordinary military success by inflicting a “functional defeat” on Russia’s naval fleet using swarms of skilfully targeted sea drones.\n\nThe contradiction, however, is likely to be more apparent than real. In a new era of state competition, and in particular the growing rivalry between China and the US, for all their size and expense, aircraft carriers remain an attractive resource for projecting power and conducting harder edged diplomacy.\n\nThis is why the US president, Donald Trump, ordered the USS Gerald R Ford – at $12.8bn the world’s largest and most expensive warship – to sail to Venezuela to intimidate the country’s regime. Capable of carrying 70 aircraft, able to operate up to 125 sorties a day at peak on some estimates, and with four destroyers in support, the manoeuvre was so unusual it raised the question of whether the force on display would be used against President Nicolas Maduro.\n\nIt is also the reason why there has been so much interest in the building and testing of the Fujan, whose formal launch earlier this week was attended by China’s president, Xi Jinping. It is a demonstration of Beijing’s fast-growing military power: its first aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, completed in 2012, was built from a hulk first made in the Soviet Union in the late 1980s and sold on by Ukraine after its collapse.\n\nIronically, as Nick Childs of the International Institute for Strategic Studies notes, China has also invested heavily in anti-ship missiles to try to protect its coast from the US. But, he says, Beijing clearly sees “aircraft carriers as an indispensable element in building a navy that can independently project power and influence globally”, because they remain “unrivalled in their flexibility” and are “incredibly useful in a whole range of potential conflict scenarios” – one of which may one day be an attempt to force a reunification with Taiwan.\n\nThe UK, which completed the build and deployment of two aircraft carriers for £6.2bn four years ago, has far less global power, making its military need less obvious. Neither ship was deployed during the Middle East conflict of the past two years, though their construction secured jobs in Scotland’s shipyards during the 2010s. Their use so far has been as a form of floating diplomacy, as demonstrated by the visit by HMS Prince of Wales to Tokyo in August to impress allies rather than to intimidate.\n\nFor now, aircraft carriers are not expected to meet a military threat with the tactical sophistication of Ukraine, never mind a peer-level opponent. Houthi rebels in Yemen attacked the USS Harry S Truman aircraft carrier and its support destroyers with drones in the Red Sea earlier this year. But the most serious damage doneduring the attack was not to the warship, but to a $70m F/A-18E Super Hornet fighterthat fell overboard when the carrier turned to avoid incoming fire.\n\nDestroyers, such as the Royal Navy’s HMS Diamond, which specialise in shooting down incoming drones, form the heart of the carrier strike groups that protect the mother ship. In theory, even if struck, carriers are designed to be hard to sink. The Soviet rule of thumb in the cold war was that it would take 12 conventional missiles to bring down a super-carrier; while it took four weeks for the US to sink USS America in 2005, a test in which the American vessel was shot at in an effort to establish how resilient it was in practice.\n\nAs for the Black Sea, the Ukrainian success came against a small, poorly organised navy, far weaker certainly than the US or China. Russia does not possess a functioning aircraft carrier, and has not had one since 2017 when the 40-year-old Admiral Kuznetsov put in for repair. The country’s shipbuilding chief said it was likely to be scrapped or sold. The failure to modernise or replace it is a demonstration of wider Russian geopolitical, military and economic weaknesses.",

    "text": "Let’s begin with the fundamental problem: Bill Gates is a politics denier. Though he came to it late, he now accepts the realities of climate science. But he lives in flat, embarrassing denial about political realities. His latest essay on climate, published last week, treats the issue as if it existed in a political vacuum. He writes as if there were no such thing as political power, and no such thing as billionaires.\n\nHis main contention is that funds are very limited, so the delegates at this month’s climate summit in Brazil should direct money away from “near-term emissions goals” towards climate “adaptation” and spending on poverty and disease.\n\nYes, the funds available for any good cause are scarce, but that’s not because of some natural law, some implacable truth about human society. It’s because oligarchic power has waged war on benign state spending, leading to the destruction of USAID and drastic cuts to the aid budgets of other countries, including the UK. Austerity is a political choice. The decision to impose it is driven by governments bowing to the wishes of the ultra-rich.\n\nThere are truckloads of money available. Just after Gates published his new missive, Oxfam revealed that the net worth of the 10 richest US billionaires grew by $698bn in the past year. That money alone, the increment in the wealth of 10 people, is almost 10 times the annual amount required to end extreme poverty worldwide. How have they managed to channel so much of the world’s money into their pockets? And why can’t we get it back through effective taxation? The answer is their translation of economic power into political power. The richer they become, the more they can bend the state and economic system to their will, ensuring that they become richer still. But Bill Gates says nothing in his essay about how and where extra money for both climate action and poverty relief could be found.\n\nView image in fullscreen ‘His essay reads like nothing so much as a peace offering to Donald Trump.’ Bill Gates, right, with the Trumps at a private dinner for business leaders in Washington DC on 4 September 2025. Photograph: Brian Snyder/Reuters\n\nThere’s a direct link between the poverty Gates claims to care so much about and the wealth he fails to mention. In the US, homelessness is breaking records, and so is the share of assets owned by the top 0.1%. While this might not be Gates’s own business model, by holding down wages, racking up rents, busting trade unions and winning tax and spending cuts, the ultra-rich thrive on impoverishing other people.\n\nA remarkable study in Perspectives on Politics, among the very few to have penetrated this secretive world, found that the ultra-rich have radically different political views from the great majority. The multimillionaires it interviewed, in stark contrast to mere earthlings, saw budget deficits as the most important of the issues it listed, and climate breakdown as the least. They were far more likely to insist that social security and federal healthcare should be cut, and far less likely to believe that the unemployed should have a “decent standard of living”, or that there should be more regulation of oil companies, banks and health insurers. They were fiercely opposed to redistribution.\n\nSo whose views prevail? The tiny minority or the great majority? Though the study was conducted in the Obama years, it found that the very rich had far more access to politicians and officials than average citizens. And now? I scarcely think I need to spell it out.\n\nThat’s another telling absence in Bill Gates’s essay: at no point in its 5,000 words does it mention Donald Trump. Were Gates to do so, he’d have to acknowledge that the second of his major assumptions is shaky: reductions in the cost of new green technologies lead inexorably to environmental progress. Of course it helps that wind, solar and other green technologies are becoming radically cheaper than fossil fuels. But Trump and similar demagogues are doing everything they can to impede the transition.\n\nPartly as a result, fossil fuels remain highly lucrative. This could be why, despite Gates’s claim that his foundation had divested all its “direct holdings in oil and gas companies” in 2019, its fossil fuel stock and bond holdings have, in fact, increased.\n\nTo Gates, overthrowing the power of the ultra-wealthy may be unthinkable. I don’t mean only that it clashes with his worldview. I mean that, judging by his remarkable silences on the issue, he might be literally incapable of thinking about it. Perhaps this is a symptom of “billionaire brain”: a profound incapacity to see the world from other people’s point of view. While the ultra-rich are notoriously hard to study, extrapolating from research into how gaining wealth and status affects cognition could suggest that acquiring huge amounts of money is like taking a blow to the head. Wealth seems to scramble certain cognitive functions, particularly those related to empathy and perspective.\n\nBut perhaps there’s also calculation here: his essay reads like nothing so much as a peace offering to Donald Trump. Trump certainly took it that way: “I (WE!) just won the War on the Climate Change Hoax. Bill Gates has finally admitted that he was completely WRONG on the issue. It took courage to do so, and for that we are all grateful. MAGA!!!”\n\nGates has always been completely WRONG on the issue, though not for the reasons Trump imagines. He has consistently lagged behind the curve, reciting fossil fuel claims (green technologies could reduce global CO2 emissions only at a “beyond astronomical” cost) long after they’ve been discredited. He has spread confusion and misinformation, such as the groundless assertion in his new essay that the purpose of Sri Lanka’s disastrous ban on synthetic fertilisers was “to cut emissions”.\n\nGates calls his essay Three Tough Truths About Climate. So here’s another tough truth he studiously ignores. If, as now seems likely, crucial Earth systems cross tipping points and suddenly collapse, the effects on human life, let alone the survival of other life forms (a topic he fails, as usual, to mention), would destroy the smooth and steady progress he foresees. Because environmental change is likely to proceed not in gradual and linear ways, but through sudden changes of state, the possible impacts on human wellbeing are extremely hard to predict. His argument that we should align all funding to current “data-based analysis” of improvements in human welfare, while it might sound rational, introduces in the face of systemic change a profound irrationality, prompting us to ignore the greatest threats.\n\nI wish we could ignore Bill Gates. Unfortunately his economic and political power makes that impossible. But unlike him, we can recognise that this power exists and, when it speaks, it does so on its own behalf.",

    "text": "Do a sum-of-the-parts analysis on ITV, City analysts have been saying for years, and you can come up with valuations way above the depressed share price. It’s just a question of someone making a decent offer for one of the two halves of the corporate entity – either ITV Studios, the production side that makes programmes such as Coronation Street, or the division that actually broadcasts the content and sells the advertising slots.\n\nNow someone has turned up: Sky, which was bought by the US giant Comcast for £30bn in 2018, has made a £1.6bn approach for the broadcasting operation. ITV’s share price gained 16% on Friday but, at 78p, it still stands way below some of the misty-eyed theoretical valuations. Why?\n\nThere’s the obvious fact that nothing is agreed yet. But there are three more basic factors. First, a £1.6bn price tag doesn’t look much for a broadcast division that, despite intensifying competition from Netflix, Disney, YouTube and others, still made topline operating profits of £250m last year. The Studios operation is undoubtedly the growing and more valuable part of ITV. But is £1.6bn really the most the broadcasting unit could fetch?\n\nSecond, the competition regulator – even when under orders from government to be “pro-growth” – will have a field day with a deal that would put the UK’s dominant free-to-air commercial broadcaster under the same corporate roof as the leading payTV outfit in the UK.\n\nThird, the pure politics of US ownership. There’s little point playing up Sky’s UK origins and pushing the notion that a deal would be the birth of new UK champion. Sky’s identity is becoming harder to spot under Comcast’s ownership: its financial performance isn’t even separated within the US parent’s accounts.\n\nOn price, nobody doubts ITV is operating in a tough market. Aside from the intense competition for eyeballs, advertising income is tied to the health of the UK economy. Total advertising revenues are expected to fall 6% this year, ITV said this week.\n\nOn the other hand, the broadcasting division has defied for a decade gloomy predictions that revenues will fall off a cliff. Old-fashioned linear TV remains the only way for advertisers to reach a mass broadcast audience, a point ITV usually likes to champion itself. Big sporting events – think World Cups in football and rugby – still produce enormous live audiences. In principle, an operation still regularly achieving 10% operating margins ought to fetch at least the value of its annual revenues of £2bn-ish.\n\nRegulatory and political hurdles look immense. ITV and Sky/Comcast can argue that the media world is transformed from a generation ago, when it was deemed unacceptable for the satellite broadcaster, then under the control of the Murdoch family, to own a significant share in ITV. Up to a point, that’s true: the game is different. Google and Facebook now soak up huge quantities of UK advertisers’ pounds, so one can have some sympathy with the argument that a UK commercial broadcaster can’t ignore international consolidation.\n\nYet ITV still bestrides the TV-only part of the UK advertising market and a combo with Sky would only increase that dominance. Then there’s the potential threat to media plurality. Comcast’s 10-year commitment to loss-making Sky News, made at the time of the takeover, expires in 2028. Would it sustain the operation if it is also running ITV’s news service?\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A new owner would have the same public service obligations, covering original UK content, including from outside London. But, one can speculate, the requirements are easier to enforce when the ultimate bosses are sitting in Shepherd’s Bush, as opposed to running a $100bn (£76bn) media empire out of Philadelphia. ITV, for all the expansion of the Studios side into making programmes globally, remains part of the British cultural landscape.\n\nNone of which is to dispute chief executive Carolyn McCall’s instinct to seek a deal. In her eight years at the helm, she has cut costs, expanded Studios, launched the ITVX streaming service and is seen as getting the big calls correct. But the share price remains becalmed and a deal of some sort is seen as the way to shift the valuation dial. It’s just not obvious that Sky/Comcast is the right one.",

    "text": "Lean in (to misogyny), ladies!\n\nAre you a woman? Do you want to rapidly raise your profile and get booked on the speaking circuit? Are you good at mental gymnastics?\n\nIf you answered yes to all of the above then gender grifting may be for you! This often-lucrative career path involves explaining to less enlightened women why feminism has gone too far and the world is much better off being run by men. You get extra points if you aren’t white, and can explain to the masses how racism is good, actually.\n\nYou can see this hustle in the tradwife content all over social media. As Jameela Jamil recently noted, all the “tradwives” preaching to young women about how they should be submissive little ladies are massive hypocrites. They’re all making money, building their brands and securing their independence while telling other women they shouldn’t be doing the same.\n\nYou can also, of course, see gender grifting on the likes of Fox News, where ambitious, albeit identikit, female anchors tut-tut on TV about how #MeToo has gone too far.\n\nAnd now, because the right has been so successful in rewriting reality, you can see gender grifting splashed all over the homepage of the New York Times. On Thursday, the Times published a transcript of a recent episode of the conservative columnist Ross Douthat’s podcast Interesting Times. This very interesting (in the British sense) piece was originally titled: Did Women Ruin the Workplace? The headline was then changed to the more nuanced: Did Liberal Feminism Ruin the Workplace?\n\nDouthat generously invites two women into his own workplace: the podcast features two critics of liberal feminism, Helen Andrews and Leah Libresco Sargeant, in conversation about “what a right-wing politics of gender should look like.” Andrews apparently caught Douthat’s eye because she had just written an essay for Compact called The Great Feminization, which argues feminism has failed because it has driven masculine virtues out of our institutions. The word “woke” or “wokeness” was used unironically 11 times in the piece: a failsafe sign you should not take anything in it seriously.\n\nAndrews continued to just mutter wokeness, wokeness, wokeness in her conversation with Douthat (variants of the word were used 25 times in the conversation), explaining that “the pathology in our institutions known as wokeness is distinctively feminine and feminized … in a very literal sense, our institutions have gone woke because there are more women in them than there used to be.”\n\nThe conversation unfurls exactly as you’d expect. Carefully cherrypicking examples, Andrews explained that #MeToo was woke, college campuses are too woke, and “the law is currently lopsided in favor of punishing male vices and allowing feminized vices totally free rein.” In response to a question about what constitutes “feminine vices”, Andrews explains that women like “gossiping” and have an “inability to deal with conflict directly”.\n\nSargeant, who has some valid critiques of liberal feminism, does her best to push back against some of this nonsense, but Andrews does most of the talking. Hilariously, towards the end of the conversation Douthat asks Andrews: “What do you like about women, Helen?” She seems unable to answer that question.\n\nI know that this is just one man’s podcast rather than, say, a piece by the editorial board, but putting a piece like this on the homepage of the New York Times in 2025 is certainly an interesting decision. Taking the sort of misogynistic nonsense that you see on Fox News and repackaging it as a pseudointellectual debate in a prestigious publication imbues these arguments with a dangerous validity. (If you want a proper intellectual interrogation of gendered inequality and supposedly traditional values, by the way, I suggest you read Angela Saini’s The Patriarchs.)\n\nWhile the New York Times is busy pondering whether liberal feminism has ruined the workplace, women’s rights are being rolled back around the world. In the very same week that this piece came out, Mexico’s president Claudia Sheinbaum was groped by a drunk man as she mingled with citizens on the streets of Mexico City. The leader of a country can’t do her own job without being harassed in public, and the Times wants us to consider whether the workplace has been too feminized.\n\nOver in the US, the gender pay gap has widened for the second year in a row, and the Times wants us to consider the possibility that wokeness has gone too far. Mike Johnson, the House speaker, recently shrugged off domestic assault allegations leveled against Republican congressman Cory Mills, and we are expected to ponder, with a straight face, the idea that the workplace is now hostile to men. Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, has been accused of sexual assault. (Mills and Hegseth have denied the allegations.) Two out of the five men on the US supreme court have been accused of sexual misconduct. The president of the US is an adjudicated sexual predator, who associated with Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted pedophile, and we are supposed to think that our institutions have been feminized. Interesting times indeed.\n\nMexican president pressing charges after being groped\n\n“This is something I experienced as a woman, but it is something that all women in our country experience,” Sheinbaum said after being groped in the street. “If I do not file a complaint, where does that leave all Mexican women? If they do this to the president, what happens to all the other women in the country?” The incident has felt like a personal affront to many women in Mexico, where violence against women and femicide are major problems. But you have to ask yourself, don’t you: has feminism gone too far?\n\nNearly half of LGBTQ+ TV characters cancelled\n\nGLAAD’s 2025 report on queer representation on TV shows a small increase from last year’s 468 to 489 LGBTQ+ characters across all platforms. However more than 200 (41%) of those characters won’t return, due to series cancellations, endings or limited series format.\n\nNew York’s new first lady wore a Jordanian-Palestinian fashion label for Mamdani’s acceptance speech\n\nWith the genocide in Gaza dropping out of the headlines, it was wonderful to see Rama Duwaji, who is of Syrian descent, wearing a top by Zeid Hijazi. “With so many people being pushed out and silenced by fear, all I can do is use my voice to speak out about what’s happening in the US and Palestine and Syria as much as I can,” Duwaji said in an April interview. Duwaji is a talented artist, whose work often examines women in the Middle East.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Week in Patriarchy Free weekly newsletter Get Arwa Mahdawi’s weekly recap of the most important stories on feminism and sexism and those fighting for equality Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

    "text": "Royal Mail says that it has “delivered Christmas” for more than 500 years, but this year many workers have been left feeling less than festive after the company downgraded a small gift to workers to second class.\n\nThe postal service, which traces its history back to the appointment of a “master of the posts” by Henry VIII in 1516, has given workers a collection of 50 Christmas stamps to recognise their work over the busiest time of year. In previous years, including in 2024, workers have received a book of 50 or 100 first-class stamps, but that has quietly been switched to second class this year.\n\nThe downgraded perk has caused bemusement among Royal Mail’s workers. It is the first Christmas since Royal Mail’s parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS), was bought by Czech billionaire Daniel Křetínský.\n\nSeasonal stamps have been a popular feature of the service since 1966, after they were introduced under Labour postmaster general Tony Benn. This year’s edition features biblical scenes illustrated by British artist Paula Doherty, while previous versions have included illustrator Quentin Blake’s 1993 rendition of Ebenezer Scrooge from Charles Dickens’s A Christmas Carol.\n\nView image in fullscreen The Christmas stamp design for 2025. Photograph: Royal Mail/PA\n\nAlthough the immediate costs of the gift to the Royal Mail would be limited to some extra printing and the delivery costs, a sheet of 50 first-class stamps would nominally be worth £85 since the price rose to £1.70 in April – more than double the price in 2020. A second-class stamp costs 87p – a potentially significant saving for a business that employs 130,000 people.\n\nThe Communication Workers Union (CWU) said that workers were irritated by the message the change sent.\n\nA CWU spokesperson said: “The decision to send employees second-class stamps this Christmas exemplifies the way Royal Mail has been treating its staff for a long time now. Whilst postal workers are disappointed at this latest development they will, as always continue to deliver a first-class service to customers and businesses across the UK.”\n\nThe change comes as Royal Mail cuts back second-class deliveries, after it was allowed to make changes to the universal service obligation.\n\nA Royal Mail spokesperson said: “Every Christmas, Royal Mail recognises the hard work of colleagues in a number of ways, including a frontline bonus, free stamps and a wider recognition programme, to thank them for their efforts during our busiest time of year. This year, we’ve included 50 second-class stamps to reflect recent changes to the universal service obligation and to help keep mail moving smoothly for customers throughout the festive season.”\n\nIn previous years the stamps gift was usually sent at the end of November, but this year’s second-class stamps were delivered earlier than expected.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We know that every gift, card and letter is important – and never more so than at this time of the year. At Royal Mail and Parcelforce we don’t just deliver Christmas, we are Christmas.”\n\nThe letter was signed by Royal Mail’s executive team. It was not signed by IDS’s leadership, or by Křetínský.",

    "text": "Blue Origin, the space company owned by billionaire Jeff Bezos, was forced on Sunday to postpone the anticipated launch of its New Glenn rocket due to unfavorable weather conditions in Cape Canaveral, Florida.\n\nRain and a ground system issue caused delays that were followed by cumulus cloud cover as the 88-minute launch window closed, leaving managers with the only option of pushing back the rocket’s planned second mission. Competition between Blue Origin and Elon Musk’s SpaceX has been intensifying in recent months.\n\nTo relieve airspace congestion during the US federal government shutdown, the Federal Aviation Administration is limiting commercial rocket liftoffs starting Monday. But after scrubbing the launch Blue Origin said late Sunday that, in coordination with the FAA, it was aiming for another attempt as soon as Wednesday within the window of 2.50pm to 4.17pm Eastern Standard time.\n\nWhen it eventually launches, the 322f (98-meter) New Glenn rocket has the task of sending US space agency Nasa’s Escapade twin spacecraft to Mars, in an effort to study the Red Planet’s climate history with the eventual hope of human exploration.\n\nBlue Origin’s launch is to also serve as a key test of whether it can achieve booster recovery, which would prove a technical breakthrough for the company if successful.\n\nNew Glenn’s inaugural flight in January was marked as a success, as its payload achieved orbit and successfully performed tests. But its first-stage booster, which was meant to be reusable, did not stick its landing on a platform in the Atlantic, and instead was lost during descent.\n\nIn its second effort Blue Origin will try once more to recover the booster stage. Thus far, only Musk’s company SpaceX has managed that feat.\n\nThe competing companies of billionaires Musk and Bezos are locked in a commercial space race that recently escalated, as Nasa opened up bids for its planned moon mission, complaining that SpaceX was lagging behind.\n\nDonald Trump’s second term in the White House has seen the administration pile pressure on Nasa to accelerate its progress to send a crewed mission to the Moon amid a race with China.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to TechScape Free weekly newsletter A weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

    "text": "Apple and WhatsApp have vowed to keep warning users if their mobile phones are targeted by governments using hacking software against them, including in the US, as two spyware makers seek to make inroads with the Trump administration.\n\nThe two technology giants made their statements in response to queries from the Guardian as the two cyberweapons makers – both founded in Israel and now owned by American investors – are aggressively pursuing access to the US market.\n\nParagon Solutions, which makes a spyware called Graphite, already cemented a deal with the Trump administration in September to give US immigration agents access to one of the world’s most sophisticated hacking tools, after the Department of Homeland lifted a freeze on a $2m contract with ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement).\n\nParagon did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAnother company, NSO Group, which was accused by the Biden administration in 2021 of engaging in business that was “contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the US”, announced this weekend that David Friedman, the US ambassador to Israel during Donald Trump’s first term, had agreed to become executive chairman of the holding company that owns NSO. The company was recently taken over by new investors, reportedly including the American movie producer Robert Simonds.\n\nBoth Paragon and NSO Group make spyware that can hack into any phone without a user ever knowing. The software can in effect take control of a phone, allowing the spyware user to read a targeted individual’s texts, listen to calls, track their location, and transform any mobile phone into a listening device or remote camera.\n\nThe companies have defended their software, saying their products are meant to be used to fight serious crime, and even thwart possible terror attacks, but both companies’ spyware has also been abused by government clients to hack individuals they want to monitor secretly, from journalists to business leaders to human rights activists.\n\nFor years, two technology companies – Apple and WhatsApp – have taken a tough stance against the proliferation of spyware around the world and have alerted individuals through notifications when possible hacking attacks are detected, including in cases in Italy, Spain, India and dozens of other countries.\n\nA US court in October sided with WhatsApp when, after six years of litigation, it banned NSO from ever targeting WhatsApp users again.\n\nBut both Apple and WhatsApp’s owner, Meta, also have a close relationship with the Trump administration, leading to concerns over whether they would continue to alert individuals in the event such spyware attacks occurred against users in the US.\n\nIn a statement, Apple said: “Threat notifications are designed to inform and assist users who may have been individually targeted by mercenary spyware and geographic location is not a factor in who they are sent to.”\n\nA spokesperson for WhatsApp said: “WhatsApp’s priority is to protect our users by disrupting hacking efforts by mercenary spyware, building new layers of protection and alerting people whose device has come under threat, no matter where they are in the world.”\n\nChristopher Wray, the former FBI director, has testified that the FBI tested NSO’s Pegasus for possible use, but that the bureau ultimately decided against including the commercial spyware in its arsenal. Experts say many legal questions surround whether spyware could ever legally be used domestically in the US given laws that prohibit targeted surveillance of Americans.\n\nAn aide to Ron Wyden, a Democratic senator and member of the select committee on intelligence, said current immigration officials provided an initial briefing to his office in which they indicated their “policies are still being written”, but have not responded to follow-up emails since the government shutdown began in October.\n\nAsked whether he would seek to have sanctions that were placed on NSO by the Biden administration in 2021 removed, Friedman said by phone from Israel: “I hope that will be accomplished, but we haven’t made that request yet” and said he had not yet discussed the matter with Trump. The former ambassador added that it was “too soon to know” when NSO would seek to have those sanctions lifted.\n\n“Nobody is protected” when it comes to mercenary spyware, cautioned John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, who is one of the world’s leading experts in tracking and disrupting the use of spyware tools against members of civil society around the world.\n\n“American businesses aren’t ready to start detecting and defending against this kind of threat at home. Nor is anybody else, by the way. Not hospitals, not lawyers and judges, not politicians, and certainly not regular citizens,” he said. “The last thing America needs right now is a silent spyware epidemic.”\n\nParagon first entered an agreement with ICE in 2024, under the Biden administration. Several people who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the relatively small contract had slipped under the White House’s radar until it was reported by Wired. The contract was then paused in order to determine whether the contract met the requirements of an ambitious executive order that had been signed by the White House in May 2023 and prohibited the operational use of spyware that poses “risks to national security or has been misused by foreign actors to enable human rights abuses around the world”.\n\nAt that time, Paragon was not associated with any surveillance scandals, unlike NSO Group, whose Pegasus spyware has been used by governments to target civil society in dozens of cases.\n\nBut that changed in January 2025, when WhatsApp said it had discovered that 90 people, including journalists and members of civil society, had been targeted by Paragon’s Graphite.\n\nParagon subsequently ended its relationship with the Italian government, suggesting Italy had violated terms of service that prohibit the spyware from being used against members of civil society.\n\nSince then, media reports have described how several Italian journalists, at least two Italian business executives, including the chief executive of one of Italy’s largest banks, Italian human rights activists, and an Italian political strategist, were each targeted with the hacking spyware in 2024.\n\nThe government of the current prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, has acknowledged the software was used against some activists by an Italian agency with legal authority, but has not claimed responsibility for other high-profile targeting.\n\n“This is the Italian Watergate,” said Matteo Renzi, the former Italian prime minister, in an interview.\n\n“This is a tool only a government can use. If the Italian government continues to deny they have used this against [multiple Italian business executives] and journalists, then the question is, who did?” he said. “I am not the best friend of journalists, but the freedom of the press is a priority in a liberal democracy. For me, it is unacceptable to use this tool against journalists.”\n\nThe prospect of Graphite now being in the hands of US immigration officials has some senior figures worried.\n\n“ICE is already shredding due process and ruining lives in its rush to lock up kids and families who pose no threat to anyone,” Wyden said in a statement to the Guardian. “I’m extremely concerned about how ICE will use spyware, facial recognition and other technology to further trample on the rights of Americans and anyone who Donald Trump labels as an enemy.”\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "summary": "Donald Trump on Sunday mused about giving most Americans $2,000 funded by tariff revenues collected by the president’s administration – an evident attempt to rally public support on the issue. “A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Sunday.",
    "text": "Donald Trump on Sunday mused about giving most Americans $2,000 funded by tariff revenues collected by the president’s administration – an evident attempt to rally public support on the issue.\n\n“A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Sunday.\n\nThe post also made it a point to call people against tariffs “FOOLS!”\n\nFor such a plan to take effect, congressional approval would probably be required. Earlier this year, the Republican senator Josh Hawley of Missouri introduced a bill proposing $600 in tariff rebates for nearly all Americans and their dependent children.\n\n“Americans deserve a tax rebate after four years of [Joe] Biden [White House] policies that have devastated families’ savings and livelihoods,” Hawley said at the time. He said the legislation would “allow hard-working Americans to benefit from the wealth that Trump’s tariffs are returning to this country”.\n\nHowever, the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said in August that the administration’s main focus remains reducing the national debt, which stands at $38.12tn, using funds from tariff collections. He said the money would be used first to start paying down the federal debt – not to give rebate checks to Americans.\n\nAccording to the treasury department’s September report, $195bn in customs duties were collected during the first three quarters of the year.\n\nThough, it appears that the cost of giving out $2,000 checks could easily surpass the amount actually collected from the tariffs. According to calculations, these payments would cost close to if not more than double the amount that has reportedly been generated so far.\n\n“If the cutoff is $100,000, 150M adults would qualify, for a cost near $300 billion,” wrote Erica York, vice-president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, on social media. “If kids qualify, that grows.”\n\n“The math gets worse accounting for the full budgetary impact of tariffs,” York added. “Adjusting for that, tariffs have raised $90 billion of net revenues compared to Trump’s proposed $300 billion rebate.”\n\nJohn Arnold, co-chair of Arnold Ventures, estimated that the dividend payments could cost as much as $513bn.\n\nAs of October, consumers were paying an average effective tariff rate of nearly 18%, the highest since 1934, according to data from the Yale Budget Lab. Since the president introduced widespread tariffs on global trading partners in April, companies have passed part of those costs on to consumers.\n\nThis isn’t the first time Trump has floated the idea of giving Americans stimulus checks based on revenue from his tariffs. In October, he said that he was considering offering Americans checks from the revenue, worth somewhere between $1,000 and $2,000. In July, the president again suggested that the government might consider tariff rebate checks.\n\nIn February, he and the tech mogul Elon Musk, who at the time was still advising the White House, said they were considering the idea of a $5,000 “dividend” check based on savings generated by the so-called department of government efficiency (Doge). These payments never came to be as the national deficit actually increased under Doge, and the amount cut from federal spending was significantly exaggerated.\n\nThe US supreme court heard arguments on Wednesday on Trump’s sweeping global tariffs and appeared skeptical of their legality.",

    "text": "A man going by the name “Rod Kissme” claims to have “very strong sperm”. It may seem like an eccentric boast for a Facebook profile page, but then this is no mundane corner of the internet. The group where Rod and other men advertise themselves is a community where women and couples come, in many cases, to fulfil a lifelong dream: parenthood.\n\nThere is a growing number of online sperm donor groups on social media. They offer people the chance of parenting children in an unregulated, dangerous but surprisingly straightforward way.\n\nMembership of groups such as Sperm Donors UK, Start a Family Here and “Get Your BABYDUST Here!” are thriving. This is due, in part, to the prohibitive cost of the official route – through a Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) regulated clinic.\n\nFor those who do things by the book, the costs can easily run into tens of thousands of pounds, especially if they do not become pregnant at the first attempt.\n\nLengthy delays and shortages of donors from certain religious backgrounds or ethnicities also drive many towards unregulated means.\n\nSelling sperm for profit is illegal in the UK and donors are allowed to be compensated only for legitimate costs. And with the illegal route comes considerable risks.\n\nIn the groups there are numerous posts from women who describe having bad experiences. One woman in a same-sex relationship said they met their donor to receive a sperm deposit, only to find he would not go through with the deal unless the couple showed him their breasts.\n\nMore alarming still are the responses, many of which tell the couple they should have gone to a sperm bank if they did not want to have a threesome with the donor. There is little time for sensitivity, it seems, in the competitive world of online sperm selling.\n\nSuddenly there were thousands of young women aged 18 to 25 joining, and membership went up to 10,000 within a year Felicity, Facebook group member\n\nHastily arranged online sperm donation can easily lead to the family courts, and judges have warned about the dangers of these ad hoc deals. Recently, a Guardian investigation into Robert Albon, an unregulated donor who claims to have 180 children across the world, revealed he has begun to seek access to his offspring through the courts in England and Wales. The situation has become a “horror story” for the women who paid for his donations.\n\nFelicity (not her real name), 39, divorced with one child and wanting another, joined the Start a Family Here group five or six years ago.\n\n“My daughter had been IVF due to male infertility – that was an awful experience so even though money wasn’t a problem, I didn’t want to go through with it again,” she says.\n\nWhen she first joined the group, it was “pretty quiet, just a few posts each week from people looking for a donor”.\n\nThat began to change a couple of years ago when media coverage led to an influx of new members.\n\n“Suddenly there were thousands of young women aged 18 to 25 joining and membership went up to 10,000 within a year. Anonymous posting started to become the norm and women were rushing in without research, asking for last-minute donations,” she adds.\n\nRecent posts include one by a woman aged 18 hoping to get pregnant, one from someone asking for a donor “with a high rate of girls” and many people asking for urgent donations.\n\n“Need a donation some time this evening,” reads one post from a woman who is ovulating and has been “let down” by a donor. Others ask for donations “this weekend”.\n\nFelicity describes the younger members as “very immature and selfish”. She says many appear to be have mental health disorders – she has seen posts from women saying they had tried to kill themselves alongside those looking for a donor, while some were “desperate to have a baby, but it seems to be a fix for their own family trauma”.\n\nView image in fullscreen Costs for IVF treatment can easily run into tens of thousands of pounds, which is one reason online donor groups are so popular. Photograph: Natalia Lebedinskaia/Getty Images\n\nThe age profile of donors seems to be considerably higher than recipients – most appear to be between 35 and 50 – so “there’s huge scope for them taking advantage and manipulating the young women”, Felicity says.\n\nOne common tactic often warned about in these communities is that men will pressure women into sex, telling those who want to use “artificial insemination” with a syringe or baster, that sexual intercourse is more successful at producing pregnancies, which is not true.\n\nSex, euphemistically referred to as “natural insemination” in these groups, is not the preferred method for most women, and yet recipients who are desperate to get pregnant can be persuaded to allow their boundaries to be crossed.\n\nMany of the posts in the groups are from people who will donate only through sex or through a method they call “partial insemination”, where the donor’s penis is inserted immediately before ejaculation.\n\nIn one post, a man complaining about rude recipients says he will no longer donate, except through natural insemination, while many, such as a young Russian donor, simply write something along the lines of: “The NI [natural insemination] method is free, the AI [artificial insemination] method is for money.”\n\nA significant problem according to Felicity is that Facebook’s algorithm promotes groups to people it identifies as having similar interests.\n\n“One swinger joins sperm donors’ group and Facebook advertises it to all his mates over in Big Women for Desperate Losers,” she jokes. “These guys hide in the background, private messaging new members and sending [dick pics], getting off talking to women about the process.\n\n“Some will go so far as to appear genuine and arrange to meet but it’s nothing more than a fantasy to them. For the women who jump in, they get taken in by those and the scammers.”\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

These prolific donors can quickly become minor celebrities in the sperm-donation universe.\n\nMen in their 20s and 30s, particularly from the US, appear to travel the world making money from selling sperm. They also cash in on influencer content on Instagram and TikTok, uploading videos about their lives and advising women how to get pregnant.\n\nView image in fullscreen Using online sperm sellers carries risks of sexually transmitted diseases and hidden genetic disorders. Photograph: Motortion/Getty Images\n\nThe German sperm donor influencer Daniel Bayen, who recently visited the UK, is one such influencer. The 25-year-old’s videos, filmed all over the world, preach openness and transparency about being a prolific donor. He answers questions from followers and talks about the rapport he builds with families he donates to, and the “pride” he feels when he sees pictures of his biological children – though he will not give any indication of how many he has.\n\nBayen was conceived through donated sperm himself and has about 30 half-siblings. He says he uses a homemade “sibling registry” to keep track of his biological children and has a Facebook group where the parents can meet.\n\nWhether Bayen’s approach is ethical is hotly debated in the groups, and he and others like him are criticised for leaving a trail of possibly hundreds of legally untraceable siblings and thousands of first cousins.\n\nIt is a problem often ignored by the adults in these communities who are so keen to have a baby: the tangled genetic backstory their children will have to unpick later in life if they want to know where they came from. This is especially the case if they do not want to risk starting a sexual relationship with a close biological relative – a genuine hazard, especially when recipient families live close to each other.\n\nIn one of the sadder posts in the Sperm Donors UK group, one woman enquires about her child’s potential siblings.\n\n“How do I find out about the other babies born from his sperm?” she asks. “Obviously there’s no sperm bank with information available as I found him in here. I could message him but I really don’t want to. Is there any other way I can find other families?”\n\nShe adds: “Any advice welcome I know there were 10 families in total and we all conceived in the same year I believe, also I remember him saying one lady was expecting twins.”\n\nMore than a dozen respondents say variations of the same thing: “You can’t.”",

    "text": "James Watson, who has died aged 97, had an extraordinary gift for science, combined with ruthless ambition and an arrogant disregard for most of his peers. These combined qualities earned him a key role in one of the 20th century’s most profound scientific revolutions, a share in a Nobel prize, a bestselling memoir, a place in science history and the anger of many of his colleagues.\n\nWith Francis Crick, at Cambridge University in 1953, Watson discovered the structure of the giant molecule DNA – deoxyribonucleic acid, found in almost every living cell – and demonstrated that all inheritance, and even life itself, could be explained by chemistry and physics. The discovery revealed new horizons in evolutionary, biological, medical, archaeological, conservation and criminal sciences, and launched an industrial revolution, all within the working lifetime of the discoverers.\n\nIn his 1968 memoir, The Double Helix, Watson recalled how, on 28 February 1953, his research partner Crick walked into the Eagle pub in Cambridge and announced: “We have discovered the secret of life.” Earlier that day they had finally cracked the mystery of the genetic code in their research in the Cavendish Laboratory. They showed how DNA carried the genetic code, written in a chemical alphabet of four letters, A, C, G and T: the letters stood for adenine, thymine, guanine and cytosine.\n\nHeralded as one of the greatest achievements of all time, it was more than just another chapter in the absorbing story of the search for the secret of life. The idea that DNA probably held the secret to understanding genetic inheritance was beginning to evolve among some leading biochemists and biologists. For Watson and Crick it was a conviction. They proved their case when they showed that the DNA molecule consisted of two strands shaped like a gently twisted ladder, a double helix, which could “unzip” to make copies of itself.\n\nIn The Double Helix, Watson wove drama and conflict into a story of an international race for glory, fuelled by boundless ambition, hampered occasionally by the dead hand of bureaucracy, and winning through to defy the received scientific wisdom of the day, all the while failing to find the other thing he most yearned for – a proper girlfriend.\n\nHis account was told with more than a trace of hubris and sprinkled with coruscating comments about his peers such as “a goodly number of scientists are not only narrow-minded and dull but also just stupid”. What also emerged was the synergy that existed between two men who, in many ways, made an odd couple.\n\nView image in fullscreen Francis Crick, left, and James Watson in Cambridge. Photograph: AP\n\nWatson and Crick met in 1951. They could scarcely have been more different: Watson a brash, competitive, young American and Crick a mature, middle-class, intellectually confident Englishman. At 35, Crick was 12 years older than his new research partner; he was also a late starter in biology. He had graduated in physics in 1938 from University College London, and his budding research career had been cut short by the start of the second world war.\n\nFrom 1940 to 1947, Crick worked for the Admiralty on the development of radar and magnetic mines, but still had no PhD. Watson, on the other hand, was a young man in a hurry.\n\nBorn in Chicago, the only son of James D Watson, a businessman, and his wife, Jean (nee Mitchell), he was a child prodigy by most standards. He was 15 years old when he got a place at the University of Chicago in 1943 to study zoology. By the time he graduated with a BSc at 19, he had developed a serious interest in genetics.\n\nThis new interest drew him to the research laboratory of Hermann Muller, at Indiana University in Bloomington, who had shaken genetics research from a moribund state. Muller helped establish the chromosome theory of heredity; but his main work, which kickstarted modern genetics, was to show that genes could mutate artificially.\n\nMuller was an irascible character, and the precocious Watson did not hit it off with him. Fortunately, he did get along with Salvador Luria, the eminent Italian microbiologist who had moved from Turin to Indiana in 1940, and under Luria’s training Watson got his PhD and developed his belief that genes were made of DNA rather than protein – the received wisdom in biology.\n\nIn the search for the evidence, he got a grant in 1950 to work in Copenhagen with the biochemist Herman Kalckar and the microbiologist Ole Maaløe. Kalckar in May 1951 took the young American to a symposium at the Zoological Station at Naples. There, Watson saw for the first time one of the first images to have been obtained of a DNA crystal.\n\nView image in fullscreen Maurice Wilkins at the launch of the £2 coin to mark the 50th anniversary of the discovery of the double helix structure in 1953. Photograph: Myung Jung KIm/PA\n\nThe image was in the form of an X-ray diffraction pattern taken by Maurice Wilkins, a biophysicist from King’s College London. After the first glimpse of Wilkins’s DNA molecule, Watson was hooked on the idea that DNA was the stuff from which genes were made. He immediately decided to change the direction of his research. Instead of trying to understand genetics by doing test tube experiments with viruses and bacteria (phage research), he wanted to explore the structural chemistry of DNA.\n\nIt meant following a line of research that ran counter to the mainstream thinking in biology and biochemistry, which assumed the gene would be protein, not nucleic acid.\n\nWatson wrote later that “a potential key to the secret of life was impossible to push out of my mind. It was certainly better to imagine myself becoming famous than maturing into a stifled academic who had never risked a thought.” He shared this with his former tutor, Luria, as well as his ambition to get a place at Cambridge because it was a centre of research on the structure of large biological molecules.\n\nWatson was lucky. Early in August 1951, Luria arranged for him to work as a research assistant to John Kendrew at the Cavendish Laboratory. Kendrew needed help with his X-ray diffraction studies on myoglobin, the oxygen-transporting pigment in muscle. Watson was given space at the Cavendish in the same room as Crick, a scientist who, by chance, shared the same conviction about DNA. So they set about solving the structure of DNA; even though a lot of the time Crick played truant from his other research, and more than once incurred the wrath of Lawrence Bragg, head of the Cavendish.\n\nWatson was not much better. At the Nobel prize-giving ceremony in 1962, he said: “Almost as soon as I set foot in the Cavendish, I inwardly knew I would not be of much help to John [Kendrew]. I had already started talking with Francis [Crick]. Perhaps even without Francis, I would have quickly bored of myoglobin. But with Francis to talk to, my fate was sealed.”\n\nWatson and Crick’s approach was to make physical models to narrow down the possibilities and eventually create an accurate picture of the molecule. They were guided by laboriously gathered X-ray diffraction data obtained by other people but under-analysed.\n\nView image in fullscreen James Watson with the original DNA model from 1953 at the Science museum in London in 2005. He excelled in the model-building and Crick in the mathematics. Photograph: Odd Andersen/AFP/Getty Images\n\nModel-building was Watson’s forte; Crick knew all the mathematical intricacies of interpreting the angles and intensities of the pattern of spots that is the image created by X-ray diffraction. Using the data, Watson and Crick made a huge intuitive leap when they proposed that the structure of DNA was a winding helix in which pairs of the bases labelled A, T, G and C held the two strands together in a special way.\n\nWhen their discovery was published in the journal Nature, their paper contained one of the most famous understatements in the history of science. They said: “It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material.” Crick, Watson and Wilkins were awarded the Nobel prize in 1962.\n\nFrom 1953 to 1955 Watson was a senior research fellow in biology at the California Institute of Technology, where he collaborated with Alexander Rich in X-ray diffraction studies of RNA (ribonucleic acid). In 1955-56 he was back in the Cavendish, again working with Crick, and on this visit they published several papers on the general principles of virus construction.\n\nThen Watson moved to Harvard University to complete major research into the role of RNA in protein synthesis in collaboration with the Swiss biochemist Alfred Tissières, the French biochemist François Gros and the US biochemist Walter Gilbert.\n\nIn 1968 he was invited to become director of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in Long Island, New York, which he turned into a scientific powerhouse. His role as administrator was unexpected.\n\nKnown for his untidiness and absentmindedness, Watson turned into a brilliant fundraiser and advocate for basic research in science. Under his direction, this renowned but financially endangered institution was revitalised. He steered the laboratory into the field of tumour virology, from which emerged much of the present understanding of oncogenes (cancer genes) and the molecular basis of cancer.\n\nIn addition to high-level research on cancer, plant molecular biology, cell biochemistry and neuroscience, the Cold Spring Harbor functions as a postgraduate university on DNA science: each year, thousands of scientists from around the world are drawn to its professional meetings and advanced courses.\n\nWatson’s successes led to his appointment in 1990 as head of a huge international research venture, the Human Genome Project, centred on the US National Institutes of Health. Designed to sequence the human genome in its entirety, the HGP was the most ambitious, generously funded endeavour in biology. Its potential dividends for medicine were enormous, albeit uncertain, and Watson rallied considerable support for what at the time seemed a preposterous gamble. Gene sequencing was a laborious, costly, error-strewn and agonisingly slow process and genetic research was itself widely regarded with suspicion in the US and Europe.\n\nView image in fullscreen James Watson announcing the completion of a map of the human genome at the National Institute of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, in 2003, 50 years after the discovery of the double helix. Photograph: Robyn Beck/EPA\n\nAt the time, many argued that the project was either impossible, or, if possible, wasteful and even dangerous. But the attempt stimulated dramatic advances in computer-driven automation, and by 2003, huge teams of researchers in new, purpose-built laboratories had completed the entire genetic “instruction manual” for hundreds of viral and bacterial diseases, for algae, yeasts, the fruit fly, the zebra fish, a nematode worm, a weed called thalecress, rice, wheat, a poplar tree, the laboratory mouse, the dog, the chimpanzee and several humans, including Watson himself.\n\nWithin Watson’s lifetime, researchers began to study human genomes by the 10,000-fold, and that one effort spawned new scientific disciplines – epigenetics, genomics and bioinformatics among them – and led to extraordinary new insight into human and other evolutionary histories.\n\nBut no organism had ever been sequenced and it took until 1995 before researchers announced the first success, the Haemophilus influenzae bacterium. Watson left the Human Genome Project in 1992, but by the time he had done so, he and his British and American research partners had agreed that their discoveries would be published promptly, each day, and made available worldwide, to prevent any individual attempts to patent human genes and exploit the information for immediate commercial gain.\n\nWatson also argued that a percentage of the project’s funding should go towards examining the social, legal and ethical issues raised by genetic discovery. He continued his work at Cold Harbor Laboratory and, in 1994, became president of the institution.\n\nHe had a rare gift both for making allies and provoking enemies. Brought up as a Catholic in the US midwest, he rejected the rightwing ideology then linked with both cultures. As a young unknown researcher in Britain, he was taken up by the novelist Naomi Mitchison and her family, and he made a large number of connections with left-leaning and liberal European intellectuals, including the great Russian physicist and scientific prankster George Gamow.\n\nThe British polymath and broadcaster Jacob Bronowski officiated as best man at his marriage in 1968 to Elizabeth Lewis. The narrative of Watson’s friendships and encounters reads like a chronicle of 20th-century biology.\n\nView image in fullscreen Rosalind Franklin and her photograph of how a strand of DNA scatters an X-ray beam. Photograph: Pearson Education\n\nHe never suffered fools gladly. “To succeed in science, you have to avoid dumb people,” he wrote in A Passion for DNA (2000).\n\nThe Double Helix – he had wanted to call it Honest Jim, a reference both to Kingsley Amis’s Lucky Jim and Joseph Conrad’s Lord Jim – provoked anger even among colleagues as clever and as famous as Watson himself.\n\nThese included Crick, Wilkins and Bragg. Watson’s revelation that he and Crick had exploited evidence obtained by Wilkins’s colleague Rosalind Franklin, without involving her in their success, also caused a storm that was to haunt him for the rest of his life. She died in 1958, four years before Nobel recognition of the endeavour, and prizes are not awarded posthumously. Crick and Wilkins both died in 2004.\n\nWhen in 1962 reporters asked him whether his discovery would lead to the genetic improvement of humans, Watson answered (as he admitted in his 2007 memoir Avoid Boring People): “If you want to have an intelligent child, you should have an intelligent wife.” Edward O Wilson, one of the great biologists of his age, described Watson at Harvard as “the most unpleasant human being I had ever met”, and dubbed him “the Caligula of biology”.\n\nWatson’s talent for the verbal equivalent of the hand grenade finally exploded his scientific career: in 2007 he told the Sunday Times he was inherently gloomy about the prospect for Africa because “all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours – whereas all the testing says not really”.\n\nThe casual implication that some genetic lineages – in other words, races – were innately less intelligent than others was too much even for Watson’s keenest admirers: the Science Museum in London promptly cancelled a lecture he was due to give, and he ended a UK tour to promote his book by returning to the US, and resigning his post at Cold Spring Harbor. As he did so, he also apologised and conceded that there had been no scientific basis for his remarks.\n\nView image in fullscreen Nobel Prize winners in 1962, from left, Maurice Wilkins, the author John Steinbeck, the chemists John Kendrew and Max Perutz, Francis Crick and James Watson. Photograph: Associated Press\n\nIn 2014, he became the first living Nobel laureate to sell his Nobel medal at auction. He told reporters: “Because I was an ‘unperson’, I was fired from the boards of companies, so I have no income, apart from my academic income.” He also said that he hoped the $4.1m sale would help him “re-enter public life”.\n\nHe got his wish, only to amplify his own public disgrace: on a PBS documentary American Masters: Decoding Watson, in 2019, he repeated the opinions he had ventured in 2007. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory trustees promptly condemned his remarks as a misuse of science to justify prejudice, and utterly incompatible with the laboratory’s mission. They revoked his honorary titles, including chancellor emeritus.\n\nThis sorry end to an extraordinary career was doubly ironic: the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory had, much earlier in the 20th century, been the headquarters of the notorious Eugenics Record Office, and its then director had once testified to the US Congress that people from southern Europe were “genetically prone to criminality”.\n\nWatson, in his years at the laboratory, had been aware of the ugly history of eugenics, and had done as much as any man to defuse public alarm about genetic research, and to challenge the kind of “sloppy if not dishonest” science once practised at his own laboratory, and used by bigots for unjust and even wicked political decisions.\n\nWatson’s finest achievements gained worldwide recognition from universities and governments, including an honorary knighthood in 2002.\n\nHe is survived by Elizabeth, their sons, Rufus and Duncan, and a grandson.\n\nJames Dewey Watson, geneticist and molecular biologist, born 6 April 1928; died 6 November 2025",

Taken to hospital after putting himself in the line of danger to save passengers’ lives, he was hailed by police and the transport secretary for “bravery beyond measure”.\n\n“There are people who are alive today who wouldn’t be … were it not for his actions,” announced the transport secretary, Heidi Alexander. But, said his family, “to us, he’s always been a hero”.\n\nView image in fullscreen Samir Zitouni was widely praised for his heroic actions last week. Photograph: LNER/PA\n\nIs there a hero inside all of us? Experts in bystander intervention say there is; that we are all more likely than not to act with selfless heroism in moments of acute threat.\n\n“The notion that people panic and run screaming for the exits is a Hollywood fiction,” said Prof Stephen Reicher, an expert in group behaviour at the University of St Andrews.\n\n“Characteristically, people stay and help each other,” he said. “We found this during the 7/7 attacks on the underground and the 1999 attack on the Admiral Duncan pub in London, where people looked after each other even though they feared other bombs.\n\n“In our own research on the Leytonstone tube attack in 2015, there was an amazing level of spontaneous coordination by bystanders: some directed others away from danger. Some distracted the attacker. Some confronted the attacker. Each was able to act because of the others. Heroism was a feature of the group, not just the individual,” he added.\n\nProf Clifford Stott, a specialist in the psychology of crowds and group identity at Keele University, agreed. Modern research, he said, showed “bystander apathy” was a myth. Instead, strangers often work together in emergency situations with highly sophisticated unity.\n\n“What modern research shows is that the public are very good at protecting themselves and that the heroic actions that hit the headlines are actually underlying, natural tendencies in all of us.”\n\nThat, he said, revealed something very positive about the human condition – but it also indicated that society would benefit from fostering and harnessing this natural capability by helping people to feel empowered to take control during emergencies.\n\n“This will become increasingly important because of the broader challenges society will soon face – at the very least, there are going to be many more climate-related mass emergencies,” he said. “We need to scaffold local resilience and build infrastructures within local communities that help them to organise and help manage that motivation that people have to step in.”\n\nProf John Drury, a social psychologist specialising in the study of collective behaviour at the University of Sussex, agreed. “Authorities arriving at emergency scenes need to support and facilitate people’s strong, natural tendency to group together and help each other,” he said.\n\nThe language used by police and other first responders was subtle but key to this, he said, pointing to the use of positive, unifying language: “Talk about ‘the community’ rather than ‘the public’, and about ‘us’ and ‘we’,” he said. “Focus on shoring up that sense of connection within the group you’re talking to, and between yourself and that group.”\n\nDr Gill Harrop, who leads the Bystander Intervention Programme at the University of Worcester, said many institutions were already actively working towards building a culture of helpers.\n\n“We’re seeing this happening now with bystander intervention training in schools, colleges, universities, policing and even the NHS,” she said. “We are slowly but surely creating communities of active bystanders. And that’s wonderful.”",

    "text": "James Dewey Watson, whose co-discovery of the twisted-ladder structure of DNA in 1953 helped light the long fuse on a revolution in medicine, crimefighting, genealogy and ethics, has died, according to his former research lab. He was 97.\n\nThe breakthrough – made when the brash, Chicago-born Watson was just 24 – turned him into a hallowed figure in the world of science for decades. But near the end of his life, he faced condemnation and professional censure for offensive remarks, including saying Black people were less intelligent than white people.\n\nWatson shared a 1962 Nobel prize with Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins for discovering that deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, is a double helix, consisting of two strands that coil around each other to create what resembles a long, gently twisting ladder.\n\nThat realization was a breakthrough. It instantly suggested how hereditary information is stored and how cells duplicate their DNA when they divide. The duplication begins with the two strands of DNA pulling apart like a zipper.\n\nEven among non-scientists, the double helix would become an instantly recognized symbol of science, showing up in such places as the work of Salvador Dalí and a British postage stamp.\n\nThe discovery helped open the door to more recent developments such as tinkering with the genetic makeup of living things, treating disease by inserting genes into patients, identifying human remains and criminal suspects from DNA samples and tracing family trees. But it has also raised a host of ethical questions, such as whether the body’s blueprint should be altered for cosmetic reasons or in a way that is transmitted to a person’s offspring.\n\n“Francis Crick and I made the discovery of the century, that was pretty clear,” Watson once said. He later wrote: “There was no way we could have foreseen the explosive impact of the double helix on science and society.”\n\nWatson never made another lab finding that big. But in the decades that followed, he wrote influential textbooks and a best-selling memoir and helped guide the project to map the human genome. He picked out bright young scientists and helped them. And he used his prestige and contacts to influence science policy.\n\nWatson died in hospice care after a brief illness, his son said on Friday. His former research lab confirmed he had died a day earlier.\n\n“He never stopped fighting for people who were suffering from disease,” Duncan Watson said of his father.\n\nWatson’s initial motivation for supporting the gene project was personal: his son Rufus had been hospitalized with a possible diagnosis of schizophrenia, and Watson figured that knowing the complete makeup of DNA would be crucial for understanding that disease – maybe in time to help his son.\n\nHe gained unwelcome attention in 2007, when the Sunday Times Magazine of London quoted him as saying he was “inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa” because “all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours – where all the testing says not really”. He said that while he hoped everyone was equal, “people who have to deal with Black employees find this is not true”.\n\nHe apologized, but after an international furor he was suspended from his job as chancellor of the prestigious Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York. He retired a week later. He had served in various leadership jobs there for nearly 40 years.\n\nIn a television documentary that aired in early 2019, Watson was asked if his views had changed. “No, not at all,” he said. In response, the Cold Spring Harbor lab revoked several honorary titles it had given Watson, saying his statements were “reprehensible” and “unsupported by science”.\n\nHe had shown “a regrettable tendency toward inflammatory and offensive remarks, especially late in his career”, Dr Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said in 2019. “His outbursts, particularly when they reflected on race, were both profoundly misguided and deeply hurtful. I only wish that Jim’s views on society and humanity could have matched his brilliant scientific insights.”\n\nIt was in the fall of 1951 that the tall, skinny Watson – already the holder of a PhD at 23 – arrived at Britain’s Cambridge University, where he met Crick. As a Watson biographer later said: “It was intellectual love at first sight.”\n\nTogether they sought to tackle the structure of DNA, aided by X-ray research by colleague Rosalind Franklin and her graduate student Raymond Gosling. Watson was later criticized for a disparaging portrayal of Franklin in The Double Helix, and today she is considered a prominent example of a female scientist whose contributions were overlooked. She died in 1958.\n\nWatson and Crick built Tinker Toy-like models to work out the molecule’s structure. One Saturday morning in 1953, after fiddling with bits of cardboard he had carefully cut to represent fragments of the DNA molecule, Watson suddenly realized how these pieces could form the “rungs” of a double helix ladder.\n\nHis first reaction: “It’s so beautiful.”\n\nFollowing the discovery, Watson spent two years at the California Institute of Technology, then joined the faculty at Harvard in 1955. Before leaving Harvard in 1976, he essentially created the university’s program for molecular biology, Mark Ptashne, a scientist, recalled in a 1999 interview.\n\nWatson became director of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in 1968, its president in 1994 and its chancellor 10 years later. He made the lab on Long Island an educational center for scientists and non-scientists, focused research on cancer, instilled a sense of excitement and raised huge amounts of money.\n\nWatson was born in Chicago on 6 April 1928, into “a family that believed in books, birds and the Democratic party”, as he put it. From his birdwatcher father he inherited an interest in ornithology and a distaste for explanations that didn’t rely on reason or science.\n\nHe got interested in genetics at the age of 17 when he read a book that said genes were the essence of life.\n\nAt the time, it wasn’t clear that genes were made of DNA, at least for any life form other than bacteria. But Watson went to Europe to study the biochemistry of nucleic acids like DNA. At a conference in Italy, Watson saw an X-ray image that indicated DNA could form crystals.\n\n“Suddenly I was excited about chemistry,” Watson wrote in The Double Helix. If genes could crystallize, “they must have a regular structure that could be solved in a straightforward fashion.\n\n“A potential key to the secret of life was impossible to push out of my mind,” he recalled.\n\nHis 2007 remarks on race were not the first time Watson struck a nerve with his comments. In a speech in 2000, he suggested that sex drive is related to skin color. And earlier he told a newspaper that if a gene governing sexuality were found and could be detected in the womb, a woman who didn’t want to have a gay child should be allowed to have an abortion.\n\nBoth of Watson’s Nobel co-winners, Crick and Wilkins, died in 2004.",

    "text": "Amazonian lakes are being transformed into simmering basins hotter than spa baths as severe heatwaves and drought grip the region, research shows.\n\nThe temperature of one lake exceeded 40C (104F) as water levels plummeted under intense sunlight and cloudless skies. The extreme heat triggered mass die-offs among endangered Amazon river dolphins and fish, which cannot survive in such high temperatures.\n\nThe shallow waters of Lake Tefé, which were only two metres deep, reached 41C – warmer than an average spa bath. “We couldn’t even put our fingers in the water. It was really hot, not just in the top bit, but right down to the bottom,” said the lead researcher, Ayan Fleischmann, from the Mamirauá Institute for Sustainable Development. “You put your finger in and remove it instantaneously, it’s unbearable.”\n\nFloating carcasses of up to 200 river dolphins washed up over a six-week period around September 2023. No one in the region had seen this happen over the past century, said Fleischmann. “It was completely surreal and really scary.”\n\nThis incident led them to look at other water bodies across the Amazon region. Half of the 10 lakes investigated experienced exceptionally high daytime water temperatures above 37C, according to the study, published in the journal Science.\n\nView image in fullscreen A satellite image from August 2024 of Lake Tefé in Brazil’s Amazonas state, showing sandbanks exposed because of severe droughts. Photograph: European Union/Copernicus Sentinel-2/Reuters\n\nResearchers analysed water temperatures from central Amazonian lakes during the drought of 2023, which was followed by another extreme drought late last year, with new record-breaking low-water levels and severe heating of the lakes. On average Lake Tefé reaches 30C in the hottest months, but in 2024, it hit 40C.\n\nAmazon lakes have been warming by 0.3 to 0.8C each decade over the past 30 or so years – rates higher than the global average, researchers found. At the same time, they are shrinking. During the 2024 drought Lake Tefé lost about 75% of its surface area and Lake Badajós shrank by 90%.\n\nAdrian Barnett, senior lecturer in behavioural ecology at the University of Greenwich, who was not involved in the research, said: “The paper shows the extraordinary impacts climate change is having, even on such huge ecosystems as the Amazon, and that these are not restricted to the forests, but the aquatic realm as well.”\n\n“A 10C increase in water temperature is unparalleled,” he said. “The volume of energy needed to achieve this in such huge volumes of water is jaw-dropping.”\n\nMost fish, and the dolphins and manatees, normally breed in the low-water season, said Barnett said, adding that it was likely that 2023 would have been a disastrous year reproductively for most species. “If this happens repeatedly, then their populations and those of the species that are connected to them ecologically, will decline severely.”\n\nThere are few local solutions to this problem, according to Barnett. “Something that’s happening at such a huge scale really requires a systems approach and that means attacking the root cause of the problem, which is fossil fuel emissions and the causes of global warming itself,” he said.\n\nFind more age of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield in the Guardian app for more nature coverage",

    "text": "It is the latest move in a growing international effort to put guardrails around a burgeoning frontier – technologies that harness data from the brain and nervous system.\n\nUnesco has adopted a set of global standards on the ethics of neurotechnology, a field that has been described as “a bit of a wild west”.\n\n“There is no control,” said Unesco’s chief of bioethics, Dafna Feinholz. “We have to inform the people about the risks, the potential benefits, the alternatives, so that people have the possibility to say ‘I accept, or I don’t accept’.”\n\nShe said the new standards were driven by two recent developments in neurotechnology: artificial intelligence (AI), which offers vast possibilities in decoding brain data, and the proliferation of consumer-grade neurotech devices such as earbuds that claim to read brain activity and glasses that track eye movements.\n\nThe standards define a new category of data, “neural data”, and suggest guidelines governing its protection. A list of more than 100 recommendations ranges from rights-based concerns to addressing scenarios that are – at least for now – science fiction, such as companies using neurotechnology to subliminally market to people during their dreams.\n\n“Neurotechnology has the potential to define the next frontier of human progress, but it is not without risks,” said Unesco’s director general, Audrey Azoulay. The new standards would “enshrine the inviolability of the human mind”, she said.\n\nBillions of dollars have poured into neurotech ventures in the past few years, from Sam Altman’s August investment in Merge Labs, a competitor to Elon Musk’s Neuralink, to Meta’s recent unveiling of a wristband that allows users to control their phone or AI Ray-Bans by reading muscle movements in their wrist.\n\nThe wave of investment has brought with it a growing push for regulation. The World Economic Forum released a paper last month calling for a privacy oriented framework, and the US senator Chuck Schumer introduced the Mind Act in September – following the lead of four states that have introduced laws to protect “neural data” since 2024.\n\nAdvocates for neurotech regulation emphasise the importance of safeguarding personal data. Unesco’s standards highlight the need for “mental privacy” and “freedom of thought”.\n\nSceptics, however, say legislative efforts are often driven by dystopian anxieties and risk hampering vital medical advances.\n\n“What’s happening with all this legislation is fear. People are afraid of what this technology is capable of. The idea of neurotech reading people’s minds is scary,” said Kristen Mathews, a lawyer who works on mental privacy issues at the US law firm Cooley.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, neurotechnology has been around for more than 100 years. The electroencephalogram (EEG) was invented in 1924, and the first brain-computer interfaces were developed in the 1970s. The latest wave of investment, however, is driven by advances in AI that make it possible to decode large amounts of data – including, possibly, brainwaves.\n\n“The thing that has enabled this technology to present perceived privacy issues is the introduction of AI,” said Mathews.\n\nSome AI-enabled neurotech advances could be medically transformative, helping treat conditions from Parkinson’s disease to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).\n\nA paper published in Nature this summer described an AI-powered brain-computer interface decoding the speech of a paralysis patient. Other work suggests AI may one day be able to “read” your thoughts – or at least, reconstruct an image if you concentrate on it hard.\n\nThe hype around some of these advances has generated fears that Mathews said were often far removed from the real dangers. The Mind Act, for example, says AI and the “vertical corporate integration” of neurotechnology could lead to “cognitive manipulation” and “erosion of personal autonomy”.\n\n“I’m not aware of any company that’s doing any of this stuff. It’s not going to happen. Maybe two decades from now,” she said.\n\nThe current frontier of neurotechnology lies in improving brain-computer interfaces, which despite recent breakthroughs are in their infancy – and in the proliferation of consumer-oriented devices, which Mathews said could raise privacy concerns, a bugbear of the Unesco standards. She argues, however, that creating the concept of “neural data” is too broad an approach to this issue.\n\n“That’s the type of thing that we would want to address. Monetising, behavioural advertising, using neural data. But the laws that are out there, they’re not getting at the stuff we’re worried about. They’re more amorphous.”",

    "text": "The devastating attack on train passengers in Cambridgeshire last weekend was shocking. There has been talk of heroes who risked their lives to help others, and of those who hid to save their lives. If you are anything like me, you will be asking yourself: what if that were me? How would I cope? And just who would I turn out to be when the worst happens?\n\nSome of us imagine that we would vault to the rescue, fighting off attackers. Others, perhaps the more realistic among us, anticipate flight, extricating ourselves from the situation as quickly and efficiently as possible. Most of us would like to think that we would stay our urge to run, lingering long enough to offer aid to those in need.\n\nPeople tend to think of “fight or flight” as the body’s natural responses to danger. But the reality is a lot more complicated. As humans, we are a social species, which means we also have the “tend and befriend” drive. You see it all the time in emergencies. In fact, my background in police psychology has shown me that one of the biggest challenges in dealing with any disaster, be it a plane crash, or a threat to a school, is managing all of the people who will inevitably converge at the scene: people running towards danger. Not to confront it, but to reach their loved ones. When we are in a life-threatening situation, we have an instinctive urge to draw those we love close to us. We also have an inbuilt urge to protect those who have been harmed.\n\nSo, what turns someone into a helper? The first thing to remember is that running away does not equate to cowardice. If someone is coming at you with a weapon, fear is sensible, flight is adaptive. Removing yourself from the situation is the rational thing to do. But once you have done that, new opportunities are then presented to you. You may not be the one who will charge down the attacker, but I’m willing to bet that once you have done what evolution programmed you to do and removed yourself from danger, you will then turn to those who are harmed, offering them aid. This is the tend and befriend response in action. Remember that few things create bonds as quickly or as powerfully as danger. Once you have survived the immediate threat, the survival of those around you is likely to become your top priority.\n\nIt also depends on who we see ourselves as being. Have we imagined ourselves as the hero? It may sound silly, but what we imagine for ourselves can create a schema of behaviour, a mental model that provides us with a template for how to respond in a crisis. Schemas are incredibly important in fast-moving situations. When our stress response is high, we lose the capacity to think rationally. The part of the brain that governs rational thought (the prefrontal cortex) receives less blood flow when we are in a highly stressful situation. So, instead we rely on other parts of the brain (notably the limbic system), responsible for things such as instincts, emotions, muscle memory and schemas. Having a pre-existing schema in place that includes us helping will go a long way towards creating that behaviour.\n\nIt also matters whether we have had experience of emergencies before. In my experience, emergency services and military personnel are often excellent in a crisis, because they have learned to quell the immediate stress response, calm themselves long enough to assess the situation and see what needs to be done. But anyone who has learned how to manage their own fear reaction can function well in a situation like this. The truth is, having survived previous crises is powerful learning for us. It tells us that we can experience terrible things, and we can survive.\n\nAnother factor is how closely a person identifies as someone who does good things. Some people spend a lot of time considering the value they add to the world. Other people don’t. If you do, you are more likely to want to help because that’s simply who you are.\n\nThe truth is that disasters, for the most part, move quickly. Moments may feel like hours, but they will pass in the blink of an eye. And then you are left, a survivor of the worst of times. If that happens, it is OK not to be OK. In the immediate aftermath of a life-threatening event, most of us will fall apart. Even if it is only for a little while. If, in the aftermath of trauma, you have struggled with painful recollections, difficulty sleeping, feeling jumpy and tearful or angry, know that this is the human stress response doing what it does best. Your brain has been presented with the most unlikely and terrible of circumstances. It now has to build a place to store these experiences – a new schema, in which you are a survivor. That can be a bumpy process.\n\nBut what we also know is that, for most people, these feelings will settle over time, as the initial stress response fades and you incorporate this new piece of you into your understanding of who you are. Sometimes, if the stress response clings on, some help may be needed to assist you in processing your experiences. Remember, terrible moments hit each of us differently, weaving their way into our past experiences and our current situations, creating a unique response for each person affected.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Matters of Opinion Free weekly newsletter Guardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and more Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

People caught up in terrible events such as the one in Cambridgeshire last weekend will probably never forget. But they will adapt. Many people who have lived through the worst of times, who now have the identity of survivor, report experiencing a sense of post-traumatic growth over the longer term. That doesn’t mean they don’t wish it hadn’t happened, that they hadn’t had to live through it. But because they have lived through it, the person they have become is stronger than who they were before.\n\nEmma Kavanagh is a psychologist who worked for many years for the police and military.

    "text": "In the 1950s, a secretary in a San Francisco medical office noticed something weird: some of the chairs in the waiting room needed to be reupholstered more frequently than others. Patients with coronary disease, she realised, nearly always arrived on time and gravitated towards hard upholstered chairs rather than comfy sofas. They’d then sit on the edge of the chair, fidget, and aggressively leap up when their names were called.\n\nThis insight took on a life of its own. First it helped inspire the cardiologists she reportedly mentioned it to – Dr Ray Rosenman and Dr Meyer Friedman, who wrote a 1959 paper that essentially invented the idea of a “type A” personality. It classified competitive, productivity-obsessed workaholics as demonstrating “overt behaviour pattern A”, and argued they were more likely to get heart attacks. They later wrote a book, Type A Behaviour and Your Heart, which became a bestseller. Familiar story, eh? A woman has an insight which is then monetised by two men.\n\nAnother familiar story: a corporation steps in to co-opt this newly popular idea. The tobacco industry soon promoted Friedman and Rosenman’s findings to argue that smoking didn’t cause cancer. Rather, they argued, smokers were more likely to be type A and that caused cancer.\n\nDecades later, videos about personality types are going viral on TikTok. Clearly, I’m type A(DHD) because I saw a recent headline about TikTok teens and their personality classification obsession, and went straight into procrastination mode. I stopped whatever I was supposed to be doing, opened 1,200 different tabs, and hyperfixated on the issue – including a long search for the name of the secretary who had the initial insight. But, if she existed (some accounts credit an upholsterer), her name isn’t easy to find. I even asked ChatGPT, which unhelpfully hallucinated and told me her name was Mrs Mabel Adams.\n\nMy conclusion after all this? Whether it’s Hippocrates’s humoral theory, the Myers-Briggs personality test, or type A/B, most personality “science” is largely bunk. But we’re all desperate for organisational systems to help make sense of ourselves and the world, so it’s compelling bunk. My main takeaway, though, is that I need to fix my procrastination problem.\n\nArwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist and the author of Strong Female Lead",

    "text": "Gen Z has a reputation for being “boring”. Not only do they reportedly prefer going to the gym than the pub, and staying at home and going to bed at 9pm rather than going clubbing, now they are refusing to sign up for medical trials. Back (way back) when I was a lad, it was all pubbing, clubbing and medical trials. And I’ve still got the scars to prove it.\n\nThe Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency states that all human medicines must undergo human testing before they are made widely available. This is mainly to investigate any unwanted side-effects. The cure for the common cold is no good if it also makes your genitals fall off. Alternatively, the side-effect may be useful when studied further: aspirin works as a blood thinner; some antidepressants curb nicotine withdrawal. It must have been a hell of a day when they tested Viagra and discovered some unexpected side-effects: its original purpose was to treat chest pain caused by angina.\n\nView image in fullscreen The author undergoing one of his medical trials.\n\nThings have gone wrong, of course. The 2006 Theralizumab clinical trial for autoimmune diseases left all six volunteers who were given the drug with severe swelling, disfigurement and life-threatening organ failure. So, lots for gen Z – already a nervous generation – to worry about. But by not volunteering, they also risk missing out on new treatments that won’t find approval as trials stall. And they should consider that if medicines aren’t tested on young people, researchers could miss discovering side-effects that only occur in the young. Someone needs to have a word. And that someone is me, as I volunteered for more than my fair share of medical trials back when I was the age gen Z is now.\n\nAt university in Nottingham, the Queen’s Medical Centre offered a smorgasbord of easy payouts. People running medical trials are only allowed to pay for a reasonable coverage of time and travel, and never officially as an incentive. But as a skint student, the amount of money I considered an incentive was somewhat lower than the regulators expected. You could spend an hour taking psychology tests for £20 cash – the price of a night out. I remember looking at weird diagrams, unsure if I was being tested for colour-blindness, or if it was a Rorschach test to see if I was a psychopath. You could have a new type of “invisible” stitching that disintegrated. Rumour had it that having your big toe amputated and sewn back on two weeks later paid out more than your student loan. True or not, I was genuinely tempted.\n\nI later lived in Sydney, where, having established myself as one of those journalists who would do anything for money, I was challenged to do just that. I got paid £20 to sit under an ultraviolet light for three hours at the Australian Photobiology Testing Facility to trial the effectiveness of sun creams. I got £35 to guzzle either a load of anti-ulcer drugs, or a placebo (I was never told which one, but mine tasted like Refreshers), at a Sydney cancer centre, give two blood samples and wee in a bottle. I nearly got paid £900 to eat Ropinirole, used in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, over 10 weeks at the GlaxoSmithKline medicines research unit, but it involved giving up alcohol, which, at the time, would have been a clinical trial of its own.\n\nMy piece de resistance was when I answered an advert in the Sydney Morning Herald from the gastroenterology department at St George’s hospital, and got paid £200 to have a long, bendy, 17-lumen silicone tube stuck up my nose, down my throat, around my entire digestive system, and out of my bottom. This – need I explain – was to help study the relationship between distal ileal and propagating proximal colonic pressure waves.\n\nGetting the tube inserted made me gag like when Ed Harris’s character inhales liquid oxygen in The Abyss. I then had to push the tube one further inch up my nostril every 15 minutes. It took three days to achieve an “all-over body floss” and for the tube to come out, erm, the other side. I then had to lie still under an X-ray machine for five hours with the tube wired to a machine, watching films on a TV turned on its side (I’ve only ever seen Mission: Impossible 2 rotated 90 degrees), so the activity around my ileocolic junction could be measured, the results of which, I was later told, played a starring role in a conference in the US.\n\nWas it worth it? Probably – although for me the cash was a big motivation. Did I help humanity with the future of medicine? In a small way, yes – and that’s what should really matter. Would I do it again all these years later? Well, considering I now also prefer to stay at home than go out clubbing, probably not. But someone has to. Come on, gen Z. Pull your pants down in the name of medical science, like I did.",

    "text": "In medical terms, the eye is not the window to the soul, but to the mind. The retina and the optic nerve are outgrowths of neural tissue, and the remarkable success of electronic implants in restoring sight shows how far brain-computer interfaces have come. These have not delivered a sci-fi vision of augmented humans with incredible new powers but, perhaps more happily, significant progress has been made, restoring ability and agency to those who have suffered injury or disease.\n\nPeople with age-related macular degeneration face a fading world. The disease, affecting about 600,000 people in the UK, causes progressive loss of central vision. There is no cure, but new trials offer something else: a new way of seeing.\n\nPatients at several trial sites across Europe, including Moorfields eye hospital in London, were fitted with a surgically implanted microchip in their retina. Just 4mm square and 30 micrometres thick, the chip functions as a pattern converter. Visual information recorded by a camera in a pair of glasses is beamed to the chip via infrared light, which the chip converts to electrical signals detected by the retina, restoring the lost link between the eye and the brain. After one year, 84% of patients in the 38-person trial were able to read letters and numbers with the device, having previously lost vision, with the average improvement equal to about five lines on a standard eye-test chart.\n\nThe line between mind and machine is shifting. Devices placed on the head to read brainwaves have allowed paralysed people to type. Prosthetics currently in trials are controlled by sensors placed on muscles and nerves remaining after amputation, and can feed back signals as well – restoring a sense of touch and proprioception. Last year, in typical hard-charging fashion, Elon Musk’s Neuralink venture implanted a chip directly into a volunteer’s brain, allowing him to send basic commands to a computer.\n\nThe dangers should be obvious. In the macular degeneration trial there were 26 “adverse events”, including retinal damage requiring further surgery. Go deeper into the brain and those risks multiply. Even then, the brain must be taught to read the signals – a reminder that these chips do not yet speak the body’s language. (An AI algorithm was used to pick text out of the visual signals more clearly, a simple example of how AI’s unique data‑processing and pattern-recognition power is made truly useful.)\n\nWith any new medical technology, cost and accessibility are an issue. The Prima device from the trial is under review by the US Food and Drug Administration and EU regulators. A CE mark from the latter would allow Prima to be considered for NHS provision. As with most prosthetic devices, this is the result of partnerships between publicly funded medical researchers and a private biotech firm, which handles any eventual large-scale manufacturing. In 2022, the NHS approved various multi-grip prosthetic hands, controlled by non-invasive electrodes that read muscle signals, for widespread use – and reported costs of about £13,000 to £37,000 per prosthetic, plus additional service costs over time. Prima and other devices in trials are a step further – a direct fusion of advanced computer technology and the human nervous system. Few novels or films dwell on cyborgs simply throwing a ball or reading a newspaper, but that appears to be our future, and it is welcome.",

    "text": "Chen-Ning Yang, the Chinese American theoretical physicist, who has died aged 103, won the Nobel prize in physics in 1957.\n\nIt was during a period at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, New Jersey, in 1950 that Yang (also known as CN Yang, or Frank Yang) befriended another young Chinese émigré, Tsung-Dao Lee. They shared the Nobel prize for work that overthrew the widely accepted “parity laws” – that the forces acting on fundamental subatomic particles are symmetric between left and right. In the popular description, they overthrew the concept of “mirror symmetry”. Although the Nobel was for this work, performed in 1956, the most far-reaching of Yang’s many contributions to theoretical physics had come earlier.\n\nAn idea conceived by Yang in 1953 was developed with the assistance of a doctoral student, Robert Mills, with whom he was sharing an office during a visit to Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island, New York. This brief encounter led to Mills becoming immortalised by inclusion in the moniker “Yang-Mills theories”. Today Yang-Mills theories underpin fundamental particle physics, successfully describing the weak and the strong nuclear forces. Initially, however, the reaction of the acerbic theorist Wolfgang Pauli was so damning that Yang’s nascent career was in jeopardy.\n\nYang’s inspiration came from the successful demonstration in 1947 that quantum electrodynamics – QED – could be a viable theory of the interaction between electrically charged particles and light. A key feature of QED is that its equations apply uniformly throughout space and time – a quantum property known as “local gauge invariance”. In the jargon, QED is known as a “gauge theory”.\n\nView image in fullscreen Yang, left, with his fellow Nobel laureate Tsung-Dao Lee. Photograph: Science History Images/Alamy\n\nGauge invariance is profound and places severe restrictions on what is possible. One such is that all electrons in the universe have the same sign and magnitude of electric charge.\n\nThe response of an electron to some stimulus, such as a magnetic field, cannot depend on whether the experiment is done in Europe, America or on the moon.\n\nA consequence is that there necessarily exists some connection linking the various electrons, allowing us to compare the situation at the different locations.\n\nIn quantum field theory this connection consists of particles with a sense of direction – “vector” particles. The connection must act over very large distances, which in quantum theory equates to the particle having no mass. In QED this is the photon, a quantum bundle of light; the photon is thus a necessary consequence of local gauge invariance.\n\nIn 1953 Yang attempted to build a theory describing the nuclear force between protons and neutrons by using the same ideas that had proved successful for QED. The proton is positively charged, whereas the neutron is neutral. The strong nuclear force can transfer electric charge between these, converting a neutron into a proton while a neighbouring proton is transformed into a neutron, balancing the books.\n\nYang and Mills’s equations took account of this flow of electric charge, and the resulting theory of the nuclear force produced a testable consequence: there exist three distinct varieties of massless vector particle, one of the trio being electrically neutral like the photon, the others being electrically charged, one positive and one negative.\n\nOn 23 February 1954, Yang spoke about this theory at the weekly seminar at Princeton’s Institute for Advanced Study. He later recalled the occasion with anguish.\n\nIn the audience was Pauli, a Nobel laureate who did not suffer fools gladly, and regarded many of his colleagues as belonging to that camp. Yang had hardly begun to speak when Pauli interrupted: “What is the mass of these vector particles?” Pauli intuitively realised they had to be massless, and that no such things exist. Yang hedged, saying he did not know.\n\nPauli sulked for a while and then repeated the question. Yang said he and Mills had thought about this, but it was complicated, and they had come to no definite conclusion. Pauli leaped in for the kill: “That is not sufficient excuse.” Yang, taken aback, sat down, unable to continue until J Robert Oppenheimer, chair of the seminar, asked him to do so. Pauli said no more, but the following day Yang received a note: “Dear Yang, I regret you made it almost impossible for me to talk with you after the seminar. All good wishes, W Pauli.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Yang in Beijing, 2021. Photograph: Xinhua/Shutterstock\n\nYang was right: it is “complicated”, and not until 1964, thanks to the work of Peter Higgs and others, was it understood that in the presence of the “Higgs field”, these vector particles can have mass. Today these massive, charged particles are the empirically confirmed W bosons, agents of the weak nuclear force, responsible for some radioactive decays.\n\nThe strong nuclear force is also described by Yang-Mills theory – quantum chromodynamics, QCD. The “charge” in this case is known as “colour”, which is carried by quarks, the constituents of neutrons and protons – a deeper layer of matter yet unknown in 1953. The force between quarks is carried by massless vector particles known as gluons. Their existence and the validity of QCD was confirmed in the 1970s.\n\nThus, Yang’s insight of 1953 is today the foundation of theories that successfully describe electromagnetic strong and weak forces. The one missing ingredient, at the time of Yang’s ill-fated seminar, was the “mass mechanism”, finally confirmed in 2012 with the discovery of the Higgs boson. When combined with Yang’s work on the violation of mirror symmetry, we have the foundation of today’s standard model of particles and forces.\n\nThe eldest of five children of Yang Wu-zhi, a mathematician, and Luo Meng-hua, Chen-Ning was born in Hefei, China, and went to school in Beijing. He graduated from National Southwestern Associated University in Yunnan in 1942.\n\nAfter two years of graduate studies, he won a scholarship to do a PhD in the US. He entered the University of Chicago in 1946, and under the guidance of Edward Teller completed his PhD in 1948.\n\nA year as assistant to Enrico Fermi was followed by an invitation to the Institute for Advanced Study, where Yang met TD Lee. In 1965, Yang moved to Stony Brook University as Albert Einstein professor of physics, where he remained until retirement in 1999, then returning to China at Tsinghua University, Beijing. In 2015 the Chinese Academy of Sciences announced that he had renounced US citizenship.\n\nIn addition to his work in particle physics, Yang made seminal contributions in statistical mechanics and condensed matter physics. In his later years he played a major role in establishing large scale research centres in China. He won many awards in addition to the Nobel prize, including the US National Medal of Science (1986) and the Albert Einstein medal in 1995.\n\nIn 1950 he married Chih-li Tu, and they had two sons, Franklin and Gilbert, and a daughter, Eulee. After Chih-li’s death in 2003, Yang married Weng Fan. She survives him, along with his children.",

    "text": "Lovable, the Stockholm-based AI coding platform, is closing in on 8 million users, CEO Anton Osika told this editor during a sit-down on Monday, a major jump from the 2.3 million active users number the company shared in July. Osika said the company — which was founded almost exactly one year ago — is also seeing “100,000 new products built on Lovable every single day.”\n\nThe metrics suggest rapid growth of the startup, which has raised $228 million in total funding to date, including a $200 million round this summer that valued the company at $1.8 billion. Rumors have swirled in recent weeks — potentially sparked by its own investors — that new backers want to invest at a $5 billion valuation, though Osika said the company isn’t capital constrained and declined to discuss fundraising plans.\n\nSpeaking to me onstage at the Web Summit event in Lisbon, Osika notably didn’t share another number: Lovable’s current annual recurring revenue. The company, which uses a mix of free and paid tiers, hit $100 million in ARR this June, a milestone it trumpeted publicly. But questions have emerged since about whether the vibe coding boom is sustainable.\n\nResearch from Barclays this summer, along with Google Trends data, showed that traffic to some of the buzziest services, including Lovable and Vercel’s v0, had declined after peaking earlier this year. (Traffic to Lovable was down 40% as of September, according to the Barclays analysts.) “This waning traffic begs the question on whether app/site vibecoding has peaked out already or has just had a bit of a lull before interest ramps up,” they reportedly wrote in a note to investors.\n\nStill, Osika insisted retention remains strong, citing more than 100% net dollar retention — meaning users spend more over time. He also said the company has “just passed” the 100-employee mark and is now importing leadership talent from San Francisco to bolster its Stockholm headquarters.\n\nLovable emerged from GPT Engineer, an open source tool Osika built that went viral among developers. But he says he quickly realized the bigger opportunity lay with the 99% of people who don’t know how to code. “I woke up a few days after building GPT Engineer and I realized, look, we’re going to reimagine how you build software,” Osika said. “I biked to my co-founder’s place, and I said, I have this great idea. I woke him up.”\n\nThe platform has attracted an eclectic user base. More than half of Fortune 500 companies are using Lovable to “supercharge creativity,” according to Osika. At the same time, he said, an 11-year-old in Lisbon built a Facebook clone for his school, while a Swedish duo is making $700,000 annually from a startup they launched seven months ago on the platform.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Plus, meet the hundreds of startups innovating across every sector. San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\n“What I hear from people trying Lovable is, ‘It just works,’” Osika said, crediting what he described as Swedish design sensibility.\n\nSecurity remains a thornier issue for the vibe coding sector. When I raised a recent incident in which an app built with vibe coding tools leaked 72,000 images into the wild, including GPS data and user IDs, Osika acknowledged the problem.\n\n“The part of the engineering organization where we’re moving the quickest on hiring is security engineers,” he said, adding that his goal is to make building with Lovable “more secure than building with just human-written code.” In fact, he said, before users can deploy, Lovable now runs multiple security checks, though the platform still requires users building sensitive applications — banking apps, for instance — to hire security experts, just as they would with traditional development.\n\nOsika was similarly matter-of-fact when I asked about competition from OpenAI and Anthropic, the AI giants whose models power Lovable but that have also released their own coding agents. He sees the market as big enough for multiple winners. “If we can unlock more human creativity and human agency . . . and just driving the change so that anyone can create if they have good ideas, [and] build businesses on top of that, that should be celebrated, regardless of whoever does that.”\n\nIt’s a decidedly collegial stance in an industry not known for it. (Even Osika has engaged in some light social media sparring with Amjad Masad of competitor Replit.) But he said his focus right now is on building “the most intuitive experience for humans” rather than obsessing over rivals.\n\nOsika described Lovable’s mission as building “the last piece of software” — a platform where everything a product organization needs, from understanding users to deploying mission-critical features, can be done through a simple interface.\n\n“Demo, don’t memo,” a popular phrase among product leaders, captures how companies now use Lovable, he said. Employees can now quickly prototype ideas rather than writing long presentations, then test them with early users before committing resources.\n\nFor all the hypergrowth and investor attention, Osika — dressed simply in a beige T-shirt and matching button-down, floppy hair framing his face — appeared very much at ease. The 30-something former particle physicist, who was the first employee at Sauna Labs before founding Lovable, has gone from open source developer to venture-backed founder to must-have conference guest in rapid succession. Yet he seemed more interested in discussing European work culture than dwelling on his company’s trajectory or the attention suddenly being showered on him.\n\n“What I care about is that everyone who’s at the company, they’re mission driven, they really care about what they’re doing and how we as a team succeed,” he said, pushing back against Silicon Valley’s intensifying hustle culture. “The best people in my team today, most of them, they have kids, and they really, really care about what we’re doing. They’re not working 12 hours, six days a week.”\n\nThough he added: “Although it’s a startup, so they’re probably working more than most jobs.”",

    "text": "January Ventures co-founder Jennifer Neundorfer stopped by the Equity podcast during TechCrunch Disrupt to chat about fundraising in this very AI-driven market.\n\nFounders and investors alike are obsessed with AI, and even Neundorfer said her firm is looking at ways to use AI to make their work more efficient, such as helping to do due diligence on the market and competition. As for companies being built, she has a preference for the founders looking to create something entirely new.\n\n“Where I tend to get excited is when I see someone who is using AI to do something that isn’t 10x better. It’s actually to create a whole new experience or workflow or behavior,” she said. “That’s what we’re looking at. Less of the incremental changes and more totally new behaviors.”\n\nThis is getting harder for founders because fatigue, she said, has hit as more AI ideas start to sound the same.\n\n“Where I think founders are breaking through is when they can communicate to investors why what they’re doing is really different than the other dozens of startups that are doing that and why they are the team to go after that,” she said.\n\nWhether we are in the so-called AI bubble or not, Neundorfer says a market correction is probably coming, and a lot of the companies getting windfalls of investor money now might not survive. The winners will navigate this moment building “truly category-defining companies,” capturing where the tech is going next. “Founders who can stay ahead of that curve, build at the edge of what’s possible today, and build for what’s coming,” she listed. “Founders who are able to really read the market and understand what it is their customer wants versus just building what is possible. Those are the founders that will have an advantage.”\n\nElsewhere on the pod, she spoke about her life before venture, where she worked at YouTube and 21st Century Fox.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\n“So much of what I did was meet with people who had great technology,” she recalled of her time at 21st Century Fox. Meeting and talking technology with people was the part of the job that gave her the most joy, and helped her realize how much she would probably love working with early-stage founders.\n\nBut the learning curve was steep when she decided to transition to investing. In the early days, she said she would constantly check in with founders and give detailed input on their companies.\n\n“That’s appropriate for some cases, but it’s really about the relationship with the founder, supporting not only weighing in on the business, but supporting them as a person,” she said.\n\nNow, she’s comfortable in the job. She serves as a mentor for various organizations, such as Techstars, and has made more than 50 investments at January Ventures, according to PitchBook, nabbing some exits in the meantime.\n\nThroughout the conversation, Neundorfer spoke about the changing venture market, funding levels for minorities and women, and about venture markets outside of San Francisco that are seeing success. Her biggest advice to diverse founders right now actually goes for many founders building in this climate: ignore the noise and focus on building a good company.\n\n“Anything else becomes something they can’t control, and the worry isn’t worth it.”",

    "text": "People often think about tech bubbles in apocalyptic terms, but it doesn’t have to be as serious as all that. In economic terms, a bubble is a bet that turned out to be too big, leaving you with more supply than demand.\n\nThe upshot: It’s not all or nothing, and even good bets can turn sour if you aren’t careful about how you make them.\n\nWhat makes the question of the AI bubble so tricky to answer is mismatched timelines between the breakneck pace of AI software development and the slow crawl of constructing and powering a data center.\n\nBecause these data centers take years to build, a lot will inevitably change between now and when they come online. The supply chain that powers AI services is so complex and fluid that it’s hard to have any clarity on how much supply we’ll need a few years from now. It isn’t simply a matter of how much people will be using AI in 2028, but how they’ll be using it, and whether we’ll have any breakthroughs in energy, semiconductor design, or power transmission in the meantime.\n\nWhen a bet is this big, there are lots of ways it can go wrong — and AI bets are getting very big indeed.\n\nLast week, Reuters reported that an Oracle-linked data center campus in New Mexico has drawn as much as $18 billion in credit from a consortium of 20 banks. Oracle has already contracted $300 billion in cloud services to OpenAI, and the companies have joined with SoftBank to build $500 billion in total AI infrastructure as part of the “Stargate” project. Meta, not to be outdone, has pledged to spend $600 billion on infrastructure over the next three years. We’ve been tracking all the major commitments here — and the sheer volume has made it hard to keep up.\n\nAt the same time, there is real uncertainty about how fast demand for AI services will grow.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Plus, meet the hundreds of startups innovating across every sector. San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\nA McKinsey survey released last week looked at how top firms are employing AI tools. The results were mixed. Almost all the businesses contacted are using AI in some way, yet few are using it on any real scale. AI has allowed companies to cost-cut in specific use cases, but it’s not making a dent on the overall business. In short, most companies are still in “wait and see” mode. If you’re counting on those companies to buy space in your data center, you may be waiting a long time.\n\nBut even if AI demand is endless, these projects could run into more straightforward infrastructure problems. Last week, Satya Nadella surprised podcast listeners by saying he was more concerned with running out of data center space than running out of chips. (As he put it, “It’s not a supply issue of chips; it’s the fact that I don’t have warm shells to plug into.”) At the same time, whole data centers are sitting idle because they can’t handle the power demands of the latest generation of chips.\n\nWhile Nvidia and OpenAI have been moving forward as fast as they possibly can, the electrical grid and built environment are still moving at the same pace they always have. That leaves lots of opportunity for expensive bottlenecks, even if everything else goes right.\n\nWe get deeper into the idea in this week’s Equity podcast, which you can listen to below.",

Executive leaders are hopeful that a viable solution will be found to ensure that Rad team members remain gainfully employed for the foreseeable future. However, to be fully transparent, despite our collective efforts, it is possible that this may not happen, and Rad may be forced to cease operations,” the email reads. GeekWire was first to report the contents of the email.\n\nSeattle-based Rad Power has gone through multiple rounds of layoffs over the last few years coming out of the pandemic. While the early pandemic days were a boon to micromobility companies like Rad Power, a “sudden drop in consumer demand” left the company saddled with excess inventory, according to the email viewed by TechCrunch. “Rad continues to face significant financial challenges, including in the form of tariffs and the macroeconomic landscape.”\n\n“At this time, Rad’s leadership is focused on supporting our employees, serving our Rad Riders, and giving Rad the best chance for longevity,” a spokesperson for the company said.\n\nRad Power is far from the only company in the e-bike or micromobility space to run into trouble recently. A number of others have gone out of business or had to restructure over the last few years, like Cake, VanMoof, Superpedestrian, and Bird.\n\nDespite the industry turmoil, Rad Power was still considered to make some of the most compelling e-bikes on the market. But faced with escalating financial pressure, the company swapped CEOs earlier this year. It brought in an executive named Kathi Lentzsch who has spent decades turning around underperforming companies.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\nLentzsch and the other executives at Rad Power have spent the last few months exploring “strategic partnerships with other companies that could acquire [Rad Power] or provide funding so the company could keep moving forward,” per the email.\n\nLast week, the company issued a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification notice to the employees at its Seattle headquarters, which told them that the 64 people working there could be laid off as soon as January 9. But this isn’t a targeted layoff, according to the email — it’s just the only Rad Power office with enough workers to necessitate this kind of mandated warning.\n\n“In the event the company is forced to close, Rad would be required to cease operations on January 9, 2026, or within 14 days thereafter,” according to the email. “In that case, Rad expects that any cessation of operations will affect all locations and departments, will be permanent in nature, and that all employees will be terminated effective January 9, 2026.”",

    "text": "Kaltura, a New York-headquartered AI video platform company, is acquiring eSelf.ai, an Israel-based startup behind conversational avatars — AI-generated digital humans that can talk with users — for about $27 million. Kaltura announced today that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire eSelf, a platform supporting more than 30 languages and featuring a user-friendly studio for creating, customizing, and deploying photorealistic digital avatars.\n\nCo-founded in 2023 by CEO Alan Bekker, who previously sold his first startup, Voca, to Snap in 2020 — and CTO Eylon Shoshan, eSelf brings deep technical expertise in speech-to-video generation, low-latency speech recognition, and screen understanding, which allows avatars to see and respond to what’s on a user’s screen. The eSelf co-founders will join Kaltura to oversee the integration of eSelf’s technology into the company, with all current eSelf employees coming on board as well.\n\nThe two-year-old startup has a small but strong team of around 15 AI experts, Ron Yekutiel, co-founder and CEO of Kaltura, told TechCrunch. He noted that Bekker’s former company specialized in natural language processing, which helps computers understand human speech, and computer vision, saying it was a “very leading company in the area of conversational speech bots. And so he’s an expert [in this field], and that’s what we bought,” Yekutiel said.\n\nKaltura offers a suite of cloud-based software solutions designed for advanced video applications, including a corporate video portal akin to a private YouTube, tools for webinars and virtual events, and integrations that embed video learning into university learning management systems, or platforms that organize online coursework.\n\nThe Nasdaq-listed company also delivers virtual classroom products and end-to-end TV streaming solutions. Kaltura’s video platform serves over 800 enterprise customers, helping them engage users across sales, marketing, customer care, education, and entertainment. Its clients include tech giants like Amazon, Oracle, Salesforce, SAP, Adobe, and IBM, as well as leading banks, insurance companies, consulting firms, pharmaceutical companies, and universities in the U.S.\n\nKaltura plans to integrate eSelf.ai’s virtual agent technology across its video offerings; the integration aims to enable agents that can listen, speak, and interpret user screens in real time.\n\n“This acquisition was so strategic. We were actively evaluating multiple companies to find the right fit. We determined that they [eSelf] were best-in-class for real-time, synchronous conversation — not just video-on-demand lip-syncing — and that they had an impressive speech-to-text and text-to-speech technology stack,” Yekutiel said in an interview with TechCrunch. “Beyond the technology, there was also a strong cultural and geographic alignment, which was critical for us.”\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\nWhy a video company is betting on conversational avatars\n\nFor the past two decades, businesses have mostly used video for streaming, uploading, and managing content. But that’s changing fast. Thanks to AI, videos can now be generated instantly — hyper-personalized and contextual — giving every viewer their own custom experience, tailored exactly to what they need in that moment, Yekutiel explained.\n\n“We started with video, then moved to personalized video, and now, with eSelf’s technology, we’re adding human-like capabilities — faces, eyes, mouths, ears — to make our AI agents conversational and expressive,” Yekutiel said.\n\nKaltura is evolving from a video platform into a video-based customer and employee experience provider, where video serves as the interface. Unlike most avatar companies that offer only a “face,” it delivers the full workflow — avatar, intelligence, and enterprise-connected knowledge. The focus isn’t just streaming video; it’s driving measurable business results and ROI, the CEO added.\n\nThe company plans to launch standalone, embeddable agents for uses including sales, marketing, customer support, and training. Target sectors include education, media and telecom, e-commerce, financial services, healthcare, and pharmaceuticals.\n\nAsked about media reports saying Kaltura was exploring a sale or merger at a $400 million to $500 million valuation, Yekutiel told TechCrunch that Kaltura has explored opportunities with a range of companies, including potential “acquisitions, mergers with similarly sized firms, and connections with some larger players.” But it never got close to a transaction like the ones being reported, he said. He also pointed to Kaltura’s recent acquisitions, including its fourth company, as evidence of the company’s continued commitment to its current strategy.\n\nThis marks Kaltura’s fourth acquisition to date. The company acquired cloud TV solution Tvinci in 2014, followed by Rapt Media in 2018, and video conferencing platform Newrow in 2020. eSelf’s most recent funding round was its $4.5 million announced in December 2024.\n\nKaltura, which went public in 2021, reports around $180 million in revenue, is profitable on an adjusted EBITDA and cash flow basis, and has about 600 employees.",

The company said at the time that later in the year, Gemini would be arriving on the 2025 Hisense U7, U8, and UX models, and 2025 TCL QM7K, QM8K, and X11K models.\n\nIn addition to the Google TV Streamer, Gemini is also available on the Walmart Onn 4K Pro streaming device.\n\nMonday’s announcement doesn’t come as a surprise, as the change is part of Google’s plans to replace Google Assistant with Gemini across all of its devices and platforms. Plus, the company had announced at CES in January that Gemini would be coming to Google TV this year.",

The startup hit $50 million profitably in its first two years, Lee previously posted. Gamma last raised a $12 million Series A round led by Accel in 2024.\n\nGamma isn’t exactly a new-to-the-scene AI startup (at least by AI standards). It was founded in late 2020, according to Lee’s LinkedIn, with its product first launching in 2022.\n\nIts more cautious raising trajectory (by AI standards) helped it hit a double-unicorn valuation on a total fundraising of about $90 million. This was achieved with only about 50 employees, Lee said. And the round included a $20 million secondary offering that gave liquidity to early employees, the company tells TechCrunch. The latest round also included participation from Accel and Uncork Capital, and its other backers include South Park Commons, Hustle Fund, and others.",

    "text": "Wikipedia on Monday laid out a simple plan to ensure its website continues to be supported in the AI era, despite its declining traffic.\n\nIn a blog post, the Wikimedia Foundation, the organization that runs the popular online encyclopedia, called on AI developers to use its content “responsibly” by ensuring its contributions are properly attributed and that content is accessed through its paid product, the Wikimedia Enterprise platform.\n\nThe opt-in, paid product allows companies to use Wikipedia’s content at scale without “severely taxing Wikipedia’s servers,” the Wikimedia Foundation blog post explains. In addition, the product’s paid nature allows AI companies to support the organization’s nonprofit mission.\n\nWhile the post doesn’t go so far as to threaten penalties or any sort of legal action for use of its material through scraping, Wikipedia recently noted that AI bots had been scraping its website while trying to appear human. After updating its bot-detection systems, the organization found that its unusually high traffic in May and June had come from AI bots that were trying to “evade detection.” Meanwhile, it said that “human page views” had declined 8% year-over-year.\n\nNow Wikipedia is laying out its guidelines for AI developers and providers, saying that generative AI developers should provide attribution to give credit to the human contributors whose content it uses to create its outputs.\n\n“For people to trust information shared on the internet, platforms should make it clear where the information is sourced from and elevate opportunities to visit and participate in those sources,” the post reads. “With fewer visits to Wikipedia, fewer volunteers may grow and enrich the content, and fewer individual donors may support this work.”\n\nEarlier this year, the organization released its AI strategy for editors, which said it would use AI to help editors with workflows around tedious tasks, automating translation, and other tools that help its editors, not replace them.",

    "text": "Carbon management startup Carbon Direct is buying another carbon credit startup, Pachama, the companies announced today.\n\nPachama laid off around 20 employees this summer as voluntary carbon markets softened. The company had attracted investments from a range of prominent names, including Amazon’s Climate Pledge, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Lowercarbon Capital, and several celebrity angel investors, including Ellen DeGeneres, Laura Dern, and Serena Williams.\n\n“The current uncertain and volatile financial, economic, and geopolitical climate, added to the anti-ESG agenda in the U.S., is indeed having an effect on corporate sustainability budgets,” Diego Saez Gil, CEO of Pachama, told Trellis when the layoffs happened. “The impact is especially acute in the voluntary carbon market, which was already in a moment of correction.”\n\nPachama had raised $88 million, while Carbon Direct had raised $60.8 million, according to PitchBook. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\nPachama was focused on nature-based carbon credits, which typically result when forests are either restored or preserved. Carbon Direct, on the other hand, is more of a carbon market advisory and accounting firm, helping companies track and report their carbon footprints and then vet carbon credits to offset them.\n\nThe carbon markets have been roiled by uncertainty in the last few years, and not all of it has been the result of political whiplash in the U.S. and elsewhere. Voluntary carbon markets have come under fire for falling short of their promises.\n\nFor example, a major investigation by The Guardian found that more than 90% of one verifier’s credits did not actually result in any carbon reductions. One of the biggest challenges facing nature-based carbon credits is the question of whether forests protected by the purchases were threatened with destruction in the first place.\n\nAnd while large companies have been dialing back their publicity around ESG measures, many are still interested in sticking to their net-zero promises. Carbon Direct customers include Microsoft, Shopify, American Express, JP Morgan, Alaska Airlines, and BlackRock.",

Back in June, the company reported that its creative ecosystem added over $55 billion to the U.S. GDP and created more than 490,000 full-time jobs.\n\nHowever, many YouTubers have reduced their reliance on ad revenue and brand deals. There are several reasons for this shift. First, ad revenue can be unpredictable. With YouTube continually updating its policies, some creators find it challenging to secure ads for their videos, which can negatively impact their earnings. They’ve also realized that income from these streams can vanish unexpectedly.\n\nRecognizing the volatility of platform-dependent revenue, many YouTubers are no longer just creators. They’re vertically integrated media companies with parallel businesses, including product lines, brick-and-mortar ventures, and consumer brands that can outlast algorithm changes and policy shifts.\n\nIn some cases, these side businesses are growing faster and more sustainably than their YouTube channels.\n\nMrBeast\n\nImage Credits:Beast Industries\n\nJimmy Donaldson, known as MrBeast, who has 442 million subscribers, isn’t just one of YouTube’s biggest stars — he’s its most aggressive entrepreneur.\n\nWhat started with a merchandise store in 2018 — ShopMrBeast — has exploded into a business portfolio, including his now three-year-old snack brand, Feastables.\n\nFeastables’ initial product was the “MrBeast Bar,” a chocolate bar that generated over $10 million in sales within its first 72 hours, selling over 1 million bars at launch. As of today, Feastables is more profitable than his YouTube content and even his “Beast Games” competition series on Prime Video. In 2024, Feastables generated roughly $250 million in revenue and over $20 million in profit, while his media business lost approximately $80 million.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Plus, meet the hundreds of startups innovating across every sector. San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\nOther ventures include his packaged food brand Lunchly (co-founded with YouTubers Logan Paul and KSI), the toy line MrBeast Lab, MrBeast Burger, and the analytics platform Viewstats. He even attempted to buy the U.S. operations of TikTok by joining the American Investor Consortium, a group of investors led by Employer.com founder Jesse Tinsley.\n\nNow MrBeast is venturing into new areas. He plans to establish a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO), which could involve partnering with one of the major operators, such as AT&T, T-Mobile, or Verizon. Additionally, the YouTuber was spotted filing a trademark application for a mobile app that offers banking, financial advisory, and crypto exchange services.\n\nMost recently, The Times reported that the YouTuber is set to open a theme park in Saudi Arabia, with rides inspired by his video content. For instance, there will supposedly be a game where six players stand on trap doors and must press a button when it lights up or fall down.\n\nEmma Chamberlain\n\nChamberlain Coffee. Image Credits:Chamberlain Coffee\n\nEmma Chamberlain, who rose to fame as a teen vlogger in 2016, now has over 12 million subscribers and has found success in the beverage industry.\n\nShe launched her coffee brand, Chamberlain Coffee, in 2019, which offers a variety of products, including cold brew, coffee pods, ground and whole bean options, as well as tea and matcha. Notably, other YouTubers have followed suit, such as Jacksepticeye with his Top of the Mornin’ Coffee brand and Philip DeFranco with Wake & Make Coffee.\n\nIn 2023, Chamberlain Coffee had a significant year, introducing ready-to-drink canned lattes and reaching approximately $20 million in revenue, according to Forbes. The brand recently experienced even more substantial growth, opening its first physical location in January. Previously, it had only an online and retail presence at places like Target, Sprouts, and Walmart.\n\nAlthough Chamberlain Coffee faced some challenges last year due to supplier issues, it’s expected to rebound, with projected revenue growth of over 50% by 2025, reaching more than $33 million, according to Business Insider. The brand is also aiming for profitability by 2026.\n\nLogan Paul\n\nImage Credits:Cliff Hawkins / Getty Images\n\nLogan Paul (23.6 million subscribers) is now known for his wrestling career but was earlier known for numerous controversies, like an infamous 2017 video and an allegedly scammy NFT project, CryptoZoo.\n\nHe also gained attention through his energy drink brand, Prime, which achieved rapid viral success in 2022. The brand, co-founded by YouTuber KSI, surpassed $1.2 billion in sales in 2023, a figure far exceeding what most content creators earn from views, ads, and brand deals. However, it has since faced declining sales, regulatory scrutiny for its high caffeine content, and lawsuits from business partners. Sales have particularly cooled in the U.K., where revenue dropped by about 70% from 2023 to 2024.\n\nAnother venture of his, Maverick Apparel, made between $30 million and $40 million in 2020.\n\nHis brother, Jake Paul, is also involved in various ventures, including co-founding the Anti Fund, which has touted past investments in OpenAI, Anduril, Ramp, and Cognition, among others. The younger Paul also owns a grooming line, called W, and a mobile betting platform called Betr.\n\nRyan’s World\n\nRyan’s World, hosted by 13-year-old Ryan Kaji, is another prominent YouTuber with a staggering following. Ryan rose to fame through his toy reviews and unboxing videos, which have captivated nearly 40 million young viewers.\n\nIn addition to his YouTube success, Kaji has expanded his brand through a line of toys and apparel that are sold in major retail chains and that reportedly generated over $250 million in revenue in 2020. Kaji and his family have since diversified their ventures, including launching a TV show and an app that provides educational content tailored for children.\n\nRosanna Pansino\n\nImage Credits:rosannopansino.com\n\nRosanna Pansino is a popular baker on YouTube known for her baking tutorials and themed treats. With 14.8 million subscribers, she gained fame for her recipes inspired by pop culture, gaming, and movies.\n\nBeyond YouTube, Pansino has released several cookbooks that have been well-received, expanding her Nerdy Nummies brand. She also sells baking tools at several retailers, such as Amazon.\n\nOther YouTubers have ventured into cookware and food products as additional revenue streams. Notable examples include cook and author Andrew Rea, known by the pseudonym Babish, who launched his Babish Cookware brand in 2021, as well as comedy duo Rhett & Link, who sell MishMash Cereal.\n\nMichelle Phan\n\nIpsy founders Jennifer Goldfarb (left), Marcelo Camberos, and Michelle Phan (right)\n\nMichelle Phan gained fame in 2007 with her makeup tutorials, becoming one of the first beauty influencers to effectively monetize her content. In addition to her successful YouTube career, she co-founded the beauty subscription service Ipsy, which has become highly popular. Phan also has her own makeup line, EM Cosmetics.\n\nHuda Kattan\n\nImage Credits:Huda Beauty\n\nHuda Kattan founded the globally recognized beauty brand Huda Beauty in 2013. She sold a minority stake to private equity firm TSG Consumer Partners in 2017 but bought it back in June after investor pressure to bring in senior leadership clashed with her vision for the fast-moving brand, which reportedly brings in hundreds of millions of dollars in sales each year.\n\nMany influencers have created their own makeup brands. Other well-known makeup brands launched by YouTube influencers include Jeffree Star Cosmetics and Tati Beauty.",

The company said it is using Gemini models across the board to power these features.\n\nAmong these new tools, the builder agent is a tool that, just like many other coding tools, lets you describe the kind of interactive map-based prototype you want to build in text and creates one for you. For instance, you can type “create a Street View tour of a city,” “create a map visualizing real-time weather in my region,” or “list pet-friendly hotels in the city.”\n\nOnce the code is generated, you can export it, test the preview project using your own API keys as needed, or modify the project in Firebase Studio.\n\nImage Credits:Google\n\nThe same tool also has a styling agent that lets users create a customized map to match a particular style format or theme. This could help brands create maps with specific color coding.\n\nGoogle already provides map data grounding via the Gemini API. The company is now introducing a similar feature, called Grounding Lite, which allows developers to ground their own AI models using Model Context Protocol (MCP), a standard that lets AI assistants connect to external data sources.\n\nWith this feature, AI assistants can answer questions like, “How far is the nearest grocery store?” The company is also shipping Contextual View, a low-code Google Maps component that can provide visual understanding to users for such questions. The feature can show a list, a map view, or a 3D display as an answer.\n\nImage Credits:Google\n\nGoogle is also adding a code assistant toolkit, the MCP server, which connects with Google Maps’ documentation. Developers can use this connection to get answers about how to use the Google Maps API and data. Last month, the company launched extensions for Gemini’s command line tool to let developers access Maps data.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

    "text": "Venmo on Monday introduced a new rewards program, Venmo Stash, offering cash back to customers who transact with their favorite brands on the payments app and engage with Venmo’s products.\n\nWhile cashback rewards are a common incentive for credit cards, Venmo’s rewards — which can be up to 5% — are returned to Venmo’s Mastercard Debit Card.\n\nThe program is designed to incentivize continued use of Venmo’s service by bringing more funds into the ecosystem, the company explains.\n\nHowever, this program also represents a new way that today’s brands are attempting to reach younger users, many of whom have shown a preference for debit cards over credit cards.\n\nOne 2024 study cited by eMarketer indicated that only 39% of Gen Z users reported frequent credit card use, compared with 51% for older generations. Another Morning Consult survey for Cash App Afterpay from earlier this year noted that 63% of Gen Z users said they favored debit cards over other payment methods.\n\nAs a result, payment providers and retailers are looking to accommodate younger consumers by rolling out more debit rewards and by offering alternatives at checkout — like the use of “buy now, pay later” (BNPL) services such as Affirm, PayPal Pay Later, or Klarna.\n\nIn Venmo’s case, the program is designed to offer larger rewards as customers interact more with Venmo products. This keeps them invested in the Venmo ecosystem, the company believes.\n\nIt also competes with other cashback incentives offered by Venmo’s rivals, like Cash App’s offers, which are doled out to its own Cash App debit card customers.\n\nScreenshot Image Credits:Venmo\n\nInitially, customers earn 1% cash back for their Venmo Debit Mastercard when they spend their Venmo balance. Rewards grow to 2% when customers turn on auto reloads to keep their balance replenished automatically. And customers are able to earn 5% cash back when they receive Direct Deposits on Venmo each month.\n\nHowever, instead of offering a certain percentage back by spending category, like groceries, gas, or dining, Venmo’s program has customers pick from curated bundles of their favorite brands. For instance, you could pick a group of brands that includes McDonald’s, TikTok Shop, Uber, and Uber Eats, or one that offers Amazon, DoorDash, Domino’s, and Walgreens.\n\nThe PayPal-owned company says that next year Venmo Stash will expand to offer customers rewards when they pay with Venmo at merchants within its nationwide network.",

    "text": "Five years ago, when Miles “Deuce” McBride moved to New York as a 20-year-old rookie playing for the Knicks, he found the transition to a big city overwhelming and struggled to find the right crowd.\n\n“When I got up here, everybody on my team was married with kids or just kind of loners,” he told TechCrunch, reflecting on his initial feelings of loneliness being the youngest player on the team. “I wish there was a way to meet people organically who have the same interests. I feel like with social media, everybody is so superficial.”\n\nRecognizing a common pain point for many in their twenties, McBride teamed up with veteran startup founder Joe Einhorn to create Mmotion, an app that combines elements of location tracking with social discovery features to help people find new friends based on shared interests while also recommending nearby bars, restaurants, and other social hotspots.\n\nImage Credits:Mmotion (Image has been modified)\n\nNow available in beta for users in NYC, the app diverges from traditional friendship platforms like Bumble BFF, instead competing more directly with apps like Snap Map and Find My. Instagram also recently entered the space with a new Map feature. (Mmotion’s beta will be limited to 1,000 members.)\n\nMmotion leverages geofencing and state tracking to follow users’ movements, highlighting people with similar interests in the vicinity. It also keeps track of where users go to recommend similar, worthwhile locations to explore. Plus, users get a private log of all their location history, acting like a personal timeline so they can easily look back on all the spots they’ve explored.\n\nTo access Mmotion, users must apply for a membership. Once accepted, they can enter their interests, join “Circles” or groups they’re interested in (such as those focused on hiking, attending basketball games, or visiting art galleries), and send friend requests to others nearby. The app also offers private messaging between users.\n\nImage Credits:Mmotion\n\nTo prioritize user safety, the app features encrypted location data that is only accessible to the user unless they choose to share it. Users are incognito by default, which Mmotion refers to as “Vault Mode,” and can be switched at any time.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\nAdditionally, if users prefer that only certain individuals on the app know their location, Mmotion offers a feature called “Personas.” This feature allows users to create up to three separate groups, enabling them to share more private locations like their home address with a select group of people while maintaining a more public persona.\n\n“So Miles might have [his “Deuce” Persona], which is something where it’s a bit more curated, because he’s a public figure. So it’s for all the Knicks fans to see Miles go to places he’s okay with mainstream people knowing. And then he might have a [Persona], for when he goes to a different city, and he wants to be really low-key,” Einhorn explained.\n\nStandard safety and moderation tools like blocking and reporting are also implemented.\n\nImage Credits:Mmotion\n\nThe app will operate on a monthly subscription model for users. While the exact pricing details weren’t disclosed, Einhorn hinted that it will be affordable, stating, “It’s not going to be more than a cup of coffee per month. It’s not going to be anything crazy.”\n\nPremium options offering additional features may also be available. For example, the basic tier only lets users join five Circles per city at a time.\n\nAnother aspect of the app is its offering for local businesses. By featuring restaurants, bars, coffee shops, fitness studios, and more on the map, Mmotion aims to promote small businesses while also providing them with insights into their customer base. The app aggregates data from various sources, including Google, OpenStreetMap, and Apple Maps.\n\nMmotion’s long-term vision is to encourage businesses to sign up for a subscription service that provides access to anonymized analytics. This service would help businesses effectively target the right customers.\n\nIn addition to subscription fees, the app will generate revenue through ads.\n\nThe launch marks McBride’s first time as a startup founder, positioning him alongside other athletes who have transitioned to entrepreneurship. Einhorn, meanwhile, is known as the founder and CEO of Fancy, a social e-commerce platform that competed with Pinterest. He also launched a luxury goods startup last year called Long Story Short.\n\nMmotion plans for a wider launch in the near future when there’s enough feedback from testers. It’s currently available to download on iOS and Android devices.",

    "text": "Nearly seven years after announcing its first fund, Sapphire Sport — the venture fund focused on sports, media, and entertainment — is spinning out from Sapphire Ventures. The fund will rebrand as an independent venture firm, 359 Capital.\n\nThe firm’s new name is a tribute to the sub-four-minute mile, a feat once deemed humanly impossible but ultimately achieved through rigorous dedication and perseverance. 359 Capital co-founder and managing partner Michael Spirito said that the name reflects the firm’s core principle of helping its portfolio founders achieve the impossible.\n\nThe separation from Sapphire Ventures, an investment firm with about $11 billion in assets under management, was always on “the vision board,” said Spirito. “We’re all grown up and ready to leave home.”\n\nSapphire Sport, which is currently halfway through investing its second fund of $181 million, has always maintained a separate group of limited partners from Sapphire Ventures. Its LPs are all deeply tied to the sports industry, including major names like City Football Group, adidas, AEG, Madison Square Garden, Sinclair, and dozens of team owners.\n\n“When we started in 2019, the name Sapphire Sport wasn’t just alliterative and sounded cool,” Spirito said. “Sport captured the LP group.”\n\nSeven years later, the sports-focused LPs still leverage their relationship with the firm to gain insights into emerging tech companies across the media and sports landscape, Spirito said.\n\nSome of the startups 359 Capital has backed include Beehiiv, a creator-focused newsletter; an online casino, Betty Labs; a sports media platform; Overtime, an AI search engine; Perplexity, a successful AI browser; and Tonal, a home gym system.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

The transitioning staff includes Spirito, co-founders of Sapphire Ventures David Hartwig and Doug Higgins, and newly promoted partner Rico Mallozzi.\n\nAs 359 Capital, the firm will continue to focus primarily on Series A and Series B startups, writing checks between $2 million to $10 million. The firm will continue to invest from its second fund through the first half of 2027, Spirito said.\n\n359 Capital will have high-profile competition in the world of sports-focused venture capital. Courtside Ventures, backed by Shaquille O’Neal and Michael Jordan, is in the process of raising a fourth fund of $100 million, according to an SEC filing.",

Vay isn’t yet commercially deployed in real traffic in Germany, where it lacked regulatory clarity until recently, but the company is currently operational in Las Vegas, where it started in January 2024. Vay now plans to use Grab’s investments to scale and expand its operations in the U.S.\n\nVay will need to hit certain milestones in the U.S. to unlock additional investment from Grab, including number of U.S. cities covered, regulatory approvals obtained, and overall consumer revenue.\n\nThe U.S. is seeing increased competition and fast-expanding offerings of various forms of remote driving. For instance, Alphabet-owned Waymo recently announced it would deploy its robotaxi service in Detroit, Las Vegas, and San Diego.\n\nAlthough publicly traded on the Nasdaq, Grab does not operate in the U.S., where it will limit itself to supporting Vay’s growth.\n\nHowever, Vay describes driverless car rental as complementary to robotaxis. As for Grab, it sees Vay as serving “a growing segment of consumers who prefer not to be car owners,” Grab co-founder and CEO Anthony Tan said in a press release.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\nVay’s customers may not be car owners, but they still need a driving license: Once the car gets delivered, the user takes over and drives it like a regular car. But unlike their own car, they don’t need to find where to park it. Vay says its service costs about half the price of ride-hailing, thanks to this hybrid approach and hardware-light system.\n\nAt the same time, the two companies plan to explore synergies between Vay’s and Grab’s business in Southeast Asia. Calling itself “the everyday everything app,” Grab’s ubiquitous super-app offers ​​all-in-one taxi, ride hailing, transport, express grocery shopping, and food delivery options, as well as digital payments and financial services.\n\nWith a growing interest in mobility, Grab recently invested in autonomous driving tech startups, including May Mobility out of the U.S. and WeRide out of China. The synergies it finds with Vay may well be on the tech side — for instance, it said that driving data collected by Vay could accelerate the training of AI models to improve autonomous driving.\n\nThis also aligns with Vay’s vision to become more than an electric rental car fleet. The company has already expanded into commercial and business-to-business services, and closed a partnership with self-driving truck company Kodiak Robotics. Ultimately, it aims to build a “global remote driving platform,” von der Ohe told TechCrunch earlier this year.\n\nAccording to Crunchbase, Vay had raised $131.8 million from backers including Kinnevik, Coatue, Eurazeo, Atomico, General Catalyst, Creandum, and the European Investment Bank. If fully unlocked, Grab’s investment would be a significant boost. But with Nvidia announcing plans to invest $500 million into British self-driving tech startup Wayve, the race is only starting.",

    "text": "For more than a decade, makers of government spyware have defended themselves from criticism by saying that their surveillance technology is intended to be used only against serious criminals and terrorists, and only in limited cases.\n\nThe evidence gathered from dozens, if not hundreds of documented instances of spyware abuse all over the world, however, shows that neither of those arguments are true.\n\nJournalists, human rights activists, and politicians have repeatedly been targeted in both repressive regimes and democratic countries. The latest example is a political consultant who works for left-wing politicians in Italy, who came out as the most recently confirmed victim of Paragon spyware in the country.\n\nThis latest case shows that spyware is proliferating far beyond the scope of what we have typically considered to be “rare” or “limited” attacks targeting only a few people at a time.\n\n“I think that there is some misunderstanding at the heart of stories about who gets targeted by this kind of government spyware, which is that if you are targeted, you are Public Enemy Number One,” Eva Galperin, the director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who has studied spyware for years, told TechCrunch.\n\n“In reality, because targeting is so easy, we have seen governments use surveillance malware to spy on a broad range of people, including relatively minor political opponents, activists, and journalists,” said Galperin.\n\nThere are several reasons that explain why spyware often ends up on the devices of people who, in theory, should not be targeted.\n\nThe first explanation lies in the way that spyware systems work. Generally, when an intelligence or law enforcement agency purchases spyware from a surveillance vendor — like NSO Group, Paragon, and others — the government customer pays a one-time fee to acquire the technology, and then lower additional fees for future software updates and tech support.\n\nThe upfront fee is usually based on the number of targets that the government agency can spy on at any moment in time. The more targets, the higher the price. Previously leaked documents from the now-defunct Hacking Team show that some of its police and government customers could target anywhere from a handful of people to an unlimited number of devices at once.\n\nWhile some democratic countries typically had fewer targets that they could surveil in one go, it wasn’t uncommon to see countries with questionable human rights records with an extremely high number of concurrent spyware targets.\n\nGiving such a high number of concurrent targets to countries with such strong appetites for surveillance all but guaranteed that the governments would target far more people outside the scope of just criminals and terrorists.\n\nContact Us Do you have more information about government spyware?

Security researcher Runa Sandvik, who works with activists and journalists who are at risk of being hacked, curates an ever-expanding list of cases of spyware abuse around the world.\n\nAnother reason for the high number of abuses, especially in recent years, is that spyware — such as NSO’s Pegasus or Paragon’s Graphite — makes it extremely easy for government customers to successfully target whoever they want. In practice, those systems are essentially consoles where police or government officials type in a phone number, and the rest happens in the background.\n\nJohn Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at The Citizen Lab who has investigated spyware companies and their abuses for a decade, said that government spyware carries a “huge abuse temptation” for government customers.\n\nScott-Railton said spyware “needs to be treated like the threat to democracy and elections that it is.”\n\nThe general lack of transparency and accountability has also contributed to governments brazenly using this sophisticated surveillance technology without fear of consequences.\n\n“The fact that we have seen targeting of relatively small fish is particularly concerning because it reflects the relative impunity that the government feels in deploying this exceptionally invasive spyware against opponents,” Galperin told TechCrunch.\n\nIn terms of victims getting accountability, there is some good news.\n\nParagon made a point of very publicly cutting ties with the Italian government earlier this year, arguing that the country’s authorities refused help from the company in investigating abuses allegedly involving its spyware.\n\nNSO Group previously revealed in court that it disconnected 10 government customers in recent years for abusing its spyware technology, although it refused to say which countries. And it’s unclear if those include the Mexican or Saudi government, where there have been countless documented cases of abuse.\n\nOn the customer side, countries like Greece and Poland have launched investigations into spyware abuses. The United States, during the Biden administration, targeted some spyware makers such as Cytrox, Intellexa, and NSO Group by imposing sanctions on the companies — and their executives — and putting them on economic blocklists. Also, a group of mostly Western countries led by the U.K. and France are trying to use diplomacy to put the brakes on the spyware market.\n\nIt remains to be seen if any of these efforts will curb or limit in any way what is now a global multibillion-dollar market, with companies more than happy to supply advanced spyware to governments with a seemingly endless appetite to spy on pretty much everyone they want to.",

    "text": "Although LLM-powered AI agents are a fairly new phenomenon, one of the areas where they’ve been most popular so far is in sales. 1mind, a startup co-founded by Amanda Kahlow, has been quietly shipping its sales agent, named Mindy, for about a year.\n\nOn Monday, the startup announced a $30 million Series A round led by Battery Ventures. This brings 1mind’s total raise to $40 million, the company says.\n\nKahlow is well known in the sales and marketing tech world as the founder and former CEO of 6sense. It was launched in 2013 as a lead-generation tool that tracked signals across social media and other sites to identify potential customers. She left in 2020.\n\nWhile the sales agent market is already crowded, 1mind, and its agent, named Mindy, aren’ doing what most of them do: sending emails and making cold calls. That’s a crowded market where even her previous firm, 6sense, offers agents.\n\n“I’m not playing in outbound,” Kahlow tells TechCrunch. Mindy is intended to handle inbound sales, going all the way to “closing the deal,” Kahlow says. This agent is used to augment self-service websites and, Kahlow says, to replace the sales engineer on calls for larger enterprise deals. It can also be the onboarding specialist, setting up new customers.\n\n“Our goal is to truly replicate the human experience across go-to-market when you have intent, when buyers are leaning in: they come to your website, or they’re in a zoom call. She can ride along and be the sales engineer,” Kahlow adds, referring to Mindy with the anthropomorphic pronoun.\n\nKahlow even goes so far as to call her AI agents “superhumans,” though they are neither human nor do they possess comic-book-style superhuman powers.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\nEach agent can, however, be trained to understand an expansive knowledge base that encompasses all of a company’s products, technical details, and competitive positions.\n\nWhile the startup uses a mix of underlying large-language models, including OpenAI and Google Gemini, the agent limits hallucinations by using deterministic AI, both Kahlow and Mindy said (I invited the agent to our call). Deterministic AI provides guardrails so once the agent ingests corporate sales materials, it should recite that info without deviation. Beyond that, Mindy is trained to say she doesn’t know an answer.\n\nWith a year of operations under its belt, 1mind is being used by more than 30 companies, including HubSpot, LinkedIn, and New Relic, to pitch and close deals. Kahlow says that her company’s entire roster of named customers all have annual contracts, not “experimental” budgets, and the “average contract is six figures.”\n\n1Mind AI agent Mindy Image Credits:1mind\n\nThe company also uses the bot internally on its own sales calls. But Kahlow has gone even further. She created an avatar of herself, Amanda, and took it with her to her VC pitches.\n\nDuring Battery Ventures’ due diligence, “we used it to go through the data room, asking lots of questions on things like case studies,” Battery partner Neeraj Agrawal told TechCrunch about the avatar Amanda. The data room refers to the stacks of data a startup will share about itself with a VC.\n\n“The conversation design is very nuanced, like what case studies it shares and when,” he said. The VC also determined that customers were having long back-and-forth conversations, indicating that they would forget they were talking to an AI.\n\nThat avatar is still accessible via Kahlow’s LinkedIn page, where the public can interact with it. It can answer questions about 1mind’s products, but also other areas, like Kahlow’s views of being a woman in tech. However, having chatted with it, it will — much like the human Kahlow — always attempt to bend the conversation toward 1mind.\n\nEventually, Kahlow says, 1mind and other agentic sales startups will even replace higher-end account executive sales roles. Or at least drastically reimagine them.\n\n“We’re not there yet where we’re fully replacing the AE. We’re replacing the website. We’re replacing the sales engineer, customer success, but that [AE/customer] relationship there is still happening,” she says. “I think over time, a lot of what the AE is doing right now will go away.”\n\nShe believes this is currently mostly a trust issue. Agentic tech is so new that a buyer looking to sign an enormous enterprise deal isn’t ready to do it without a human.\n\nInterestingly, once trust develops, she thinks (and is already building for) agent-to-agent transactions won’t involve human avatars but will instead be transfers of information and requirements.\n\nIn the meantime, 1mind still employs humans: 44 of them, including in sales, with 71 job openings, including for account execs.\n\nThe round included participation from Primary Ventures, Wing Venture Capital, Operator Collective, Harmonic Growth Partners, and Success Venture Partners, as well as angels from Monday.com, ZoomInfo, Databricks, Box, Gong, Braze, and Verkada, 1mind said.",

    "text": "After helping thousands of enterprises document how work actually happens, Scribe has raised $75 million at a $1.3 billion post-money valuation to roll out Scribe Optimize, a platform that maps workflows across the enterprise to reveal where automation and AI will actually yield returns — instead of becoming another sunk cost.\n\nThe all-equity Series C round was led by StepStone, with participation from existing investors Amplify Partners, Redpoint Ventures, Tiger Global, Morado Ventures, and New York Life Ventures. The new funding comes over a year after Scribe raised its $25 million Series B, capital the five-year-old startup has largely not needed to draw down, co-founder and CEO Jennifer Smith (pictured above, left) said in an exclusive interview. With this round, Scribe plans to accelerate the rollout of Scribe Optimize and related products, as enterprises struggle to determine where AI and automation will have the greatest impact.\n\nMany companies are racing to adopt AI, but Smith told TechCrunch that most still cannot answer a fundamental question: What should we automate first? Enterprises often try to find the answer through interviews, workshops, or by bringing in consultants, she said, approaches that take months and still miss much of what people actually do on a day-to-day basis.\n\n“Without really knowing how work is done, it is really hard to know where to improve it, where to automate it, where agents can help,” she said. “Scribe Optimize is all about answering that question. Very simply, it mines across workflows for what people are doing when they’re at work, and then it abstracts those up into being able to show you in a single pane of glass, here are the actual workflows that are being done. Here’s how often, how long it takes, etc.”\n\nFounded in 2019 by Smith and CTO Aaron Podolny (pictured above, right), Scribe started before the GenAI boom, and its current flagship product, Scribe Capture, helps automatically document how work is done. When someone completes a process or workflow, Capture generates a step-by-step guide using its browser extension and desktop app, along with text and screenshots. Those guides can be shared with colleagues or embedded in internal tools to reduce repeated questions, minimize errors, and expedite onboarding.\n\nCustomers using Scribe Capture report saving 35 to 42 hours per person per month and making new hires 40% faster, the startup said.\n\nThe market of process documentation includes players including Tango, Iorad, UserGuiding, and Spekit. Nonetheless, Smith told TechCrunch that Scribe competes against the status quo of people manually recording workflows.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\n“People are still using stopwatches to sit behind somebody and understand what this process is,” she said. “Even now, when it comes to deploying AI agents, the irony is that the process of deploying agents is incredibly manual.”\n\nTo date, Scribe has documented more than 10 million workflows across 40,000 software applications. The startup said that it has more than 5 million users and is used by teams inside 94% of Fortune 500 companies. Further, 78,000 organizations are its paid customers. It counts teams at New York Life, T-Mobile, LinkedIn, HubSpot, and Northern Trust among its users.\n\n“Users come to Scribe not because their boss tells them to, but because they want to,” Smith told TechCrunch. “It starts with the end user, and then goes up to their team lead, department lead, and then some kind of central function who are all interested in it for the question of, how do we scale, what we know, how to do, and how do we get better?”\n\nThe San Francisco-based startup sees the U.K., Canada, Australia, and Europe among its biggest markets after the U.S.\n\nScribe said it has more than doubled its revenue over the past year, though it did not disclose figures, and also said its valuation has increased fivefold since its last round. The startup currently has a headcount of 120 employees, and it plans to double that number in the next 12 months, Smith said.",

But for now, the tactics appear to have worked, after a group of Democrats agreed to support a bill to end the shutdown and drop the concessions their party had demanded.\n\n“Standing up to Donald Trump didn’t work,” said Senator Angus King, independent of Maine who caucuses with the Democrats, said on MSNBC Monday. “It actually gave him more power.”",

We’re on the hook for all of that.”\n\nFor the better part of two years, well before the federal government shut down and SNAP payments were paused, lower-income consumers have been slowing their spending, especially for discretionary items.

Conservative groups and state lawmakers said they were disappointed that the court was not taking up the issue now, but would continue to press legal challenges.\n\nBefore the denial, legal experts had speculated that the court was unlikely to reconsider the issue at this juncture. But the stakes were so high for families and same-sex couples, advocates of same-sex marriage said, that many people were on tenterhooks waiting for a decision.\n\nThe petition had come from Kim Davis, a Kentucky county clerk who was jailed for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples after the landmark decision in 2015, Obergefell v. Hodges. If the Supreme Court were to overturn Obergefell, many state laws that prohibit same-sex couples from marrying would snap back into effect. Congress enacted a federal statute in 2022 mandating that marriages performed by states be given recognition by the federal government, but that statute does not guarantee a right to marry.\n\n“Do I think it’s a pure victory and we have nothing to worry about?” Jim Obergefell, the named plaintiff in the original case, said on Monday. “No, but I am taking the win today. Everyone across the country who believes that we deserve the right to marry the person we love, whoever we call home, we’re all breathing a bit easier.”",

    "text": "One of literature’s pre-eminent awards, the Booker Prize is given each year to the book deemed to be best novel written in English and published in Britain or Ireland. Last year, Samantha Harvey triumphed with “Orbital,” a novel set aboard the International Space Station. In recent years, the Booker has acquired a global following, and winning titles often become hits on both sides of the Atlantic. As well as a boost in sales, the winning author receives a cash prize of 50,000 pounds, about $65,800.\n\nImage\n\n“Flesh” has attracted a host of high-profile admirers since its publication in March, including the pop star Dua Lipa, who chose the novel for her book club, and the novelist Zadie Smith, who told a BBC radio show that “Flesh” was “astonishing.” Some novelists give their characters incredibly complicated inner lives, Smith said, but Szalay had the confidence to create a lead who doesn’t reflect much on the events that befall him, and who felt realistic because of that.\n\n“Sometimes when I’m reading, one of the things I’m looking for is, ‘How has this person made the novel new?’” Smith said: “For me, this novel was new.”\n\nReviewers also praised the book, even when they had quibbles. Dwight Garner, writing in The New York Times, said that he admired “Flesh” “from front to back without ever quite liking it, without ever quite giving into it.” But Luke Brown, in The Financial Times, called the book “refreshing, illuminating and true” for its portrait of a man who has stints as a soldier, security guard and property developer.\n\nSzalay, 51, whose name is pronounced SOL-loy, is the author of five previous books. Those include his 2008 debut, “London and the South-East,” about a sales executive who ends up stocking shelves in a grocery store; “Turbulence,” a series of interconnected stories in which all of the characters take flights; and “All That Man Is,” about men in various states of duress.",

Examples include whether a player will score more or less than a certain number of points, whether a specific batter will hit a home run or whether a game will reach overtime. Prop bets are also combined into a riskier wager that is growing in popularity, the parlay, which involves two or more outcomes.\n\nProp bets are a core business for betting companies, or sportsbooks. Chris Grove, a partner emeritus at Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, a research firm, said that prop bets, at a conservative estimate, account for around 20 percent of money wagered at regulated sportsbooks in the United States.\n\nWhat is a microbet?\n\nMicrobets are a subset of proposition bets. They can be resolved within seconds and are tied to live game action. Examples include whether the next basket will be for two points or for three, or the outcome of a single baseball pitch. Jason Robins, chief executive of DraftKings, said on an August earnings call that microbets account for a single-digit percentage of the total money wagered at the sportsbooks.",

Experts say not enough people are calling the toll-free numbers meant to help, and fewer go to therapy or make it through recovery programs.\n\nTherapists, researchers and recovering gamblers have begun to wonder if it is time to consider different approaches to addressing the problems specific to online gambling.\n\nRepresentatives from the gambling industry say that they are committed to helping problem gamblers. The companies spend millions of dollars promoting responsible betting, and most of the state funds used on addiction recovery come from taxes on gambling.",

But it was hard to find anyone in the crowd not buoyed by what Mr. Moreno called “a day of hope.”",

    "text": "As torrential floodwaters roared through Camp Mystic in the first dark hours of July 4, top leaders at the all-girls retreat in Central Texas spent more than an hour securing the camp’s equipment instead of evacuating or even checking on campers, according to a lawsuit filed on Monday by the families of five campers and two counselors who died that night.\n\nThe suit, filed in a state court in Austin, Texas, names Camp Mystic and individual members of the Eastland family, who have owned and operated the Hill Country camp for generations, among the defendants. It portrays the family as overconfident and woefully underprepared for serious flooding, despite decades of experience and ample warnings.\n\nThe suit claims that Dick Eastland, the camp’s executive director, and his son Edward, a director, squandered a crucial window of time following the National Weather Service’s warning about “life threatening flash flooding” at 1:14 a.m. The leadership dismissed camp counselors’ early pleas for help, and then “made a hopeless ‘rescue’ effort from its self-created disaster” only when it was too late, the lawsuit says.\n\nTwo counselors and 25 young campers died at Camp Mystic that night, most of them from two cabins that housed the youngest girls. Dick Eastland, 70, also died. Other camps along the Guadalupe River had to evacuate and rescue campers from the flooding, but Camp Mystic was the only sleepaway camp where campers died.",

If A.I. technologies do not pull in as much revenue as expected over the next several years, the debt-laden companies could be left holding the bag for the rest of the industry.\n\n“People are lending an awful lot of money to companies based on speculative returns,” said Gil Luria, head of technology research at the technology analyst D.A. Davidson.\n\nThe shift to debt financing is reminiscent of the dot-com boom in the late 1990s, when many companies racked up debt as they raced to lay the fiber-optic cables that would become today’s high-speed internet. When the bubble burst, companies like WorldCom, Global Crossing and Lucent went bankrupt or had to sell themselves to larger rivals.",

Over the past several decades, media executives watched as the internet upended their business, laying waste to classified advertising and siphoning away readers to social media. And many have come to realize they were flat-footed in the face of the technology transformation, giving away news content in the hopes of clawing back some digital advertising revenue.\n\nThe executives are eager to not make the same mistake with A.I. They are trying to force tech giants to pay for the original content used to train and service the large language models, either through commercial agreements or lawsuits — or both. (The New York Times, which has an A.I. licensing deal with Amazon, has sued OpenAI and its partner, Microsoft, claiming copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems. OpenAI and Microsoft have denied those claims.)\n\nProponents of A.I. in newsrooms say that regardless of the business implications, the technology is a powerful new tool to aid with reporting and editing and engage readers. And they are racing to figure out how to take advantage of that.\n\nNewsquest, a British newspaper chain owned by USA Today Company, employs more than 30 journalists who use A.I. to delve deeper into stories. Axel Springer, the Berlin-based owner of Politico and Business Insider, recently used A.I. to create an interactive travel planner. Time magazine used an A.I.-powered chatbot for its 2024 Person of the Year featuring President Trump. The New York Times has a team that experiments with A.I. and builds reporting tools.\n\nAxios, the Beltway publication that has been outspokenly pro-A.I., is experimenting with the technology for its Axios Local newsletters and automating news roundups by using OpenAI’s ChatGPT to find the most relevant news stories of the day, with oversight by a reporter, said Allison Murphy, the chief operating officer of Axios.",

Please review the episode audio before quoting from this transcript and email transcripts@nytimes.com with any questions.\n\ncasey newton\n\nCasey, did you hear about the Waymo KitKat incident? [SIGHS]: I did a very sad story, unfortunately.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYes, so Waymo, in San Francisco, hit and killed a bodega cat in the Mission District named KitKat.\n\ncasey newton\n\nNamed KitKat, of course. And this was a beloved cat in the community.\n\nkevin roose\n\nThis was a gray tabby, was the store mascot and pet of the owner at a bodega on 16th Street. And yeah, this was a very sad incident. There’s now actually a “Remember KitKat” rally that’s being held by a district supervisor. So KitKat is in our prayers.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah. Now, you had an interesting tweet about this. I’ll just read this here. You said, “It’s KitKat’s fault. Get out of the damn road when there’s a Waymo nearby.” Do you want to explain that?\n\nkevin roose\n\nThat was not me.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYou didn’t write that?\n\nkevin roose\n\nI did not write that.\n\ncasey newton\n\nOh! Sorry.\n\nkevin roose\n\nI’m pro KitKat. I’m more of a dog guy. But cats deserve to live, too. [MUSIC PLAYING] I’m Kevin Roose, a tech columnist at “The New York Times.”\n\ncasey newton\n\nI’m Casey Newton from Platformer.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAnd this is “Hard Fork.”\n\ncasey newton\n\nThis week, the humanoid robot that has the internet abuzz. We’ll talk to 1X CEO Bernt Bornich about Neo, and then put it to work. And then around of HatGPT. [MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nkevin roose\n\nWell, Casey, we’ve got a big first on “Hard Fork” this week. Our first humanoid robot guest.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYes, and I’m thrilled about this. We tried to book a humanoid robot for the “Hard Fork” live show. We could not get it to happen. But fast forward a few months, and finally, there is a robot that’s willing to come on the show, Kevin.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYes, and this robot is having a moment right now. It’s fair to say. This is the Neo robot. It’s made by a company called 1X. And Joanna Stern, “Wall Street Journal” tech columnist and friend of the pod, did a great video about Neo last week that went viral and got lots of pickup from lots of places, and people were buzzing about this new humanlike robot.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah, and on one hand, you have people telling every joke you can imagine, people who are worried about the privacy implications of having this kind of surveillance machine in the house at all times. And then you have other people who have been ready for a robot to do all of their chores since they watched “The Jetsons” way back in the day, and are curious whether this could be the thing that actually makes that happen.\n\nkevin roose\n\nRight, so a lot of the conversation around Joanna’s story and video last week was about how there’s this gap right now between what people want this robot to be able to do, which is do all their chores for them, and what it can actually do right now, which is not much of that. For right now, the robot is still mostly teleoperated, so a human wearing a VR headset is controlling the motions of the Neo robot when it’s doing most of its tasks. But the long-term vision for this is that over time, as these things get sold to people who put them in their homes, and they’re sort of able to gather that data and use that to improve themselves, that these robots will become fully autonomous at some point in the near future.\n\ncasey newton\n\nThat’s right. And if you want to preorder it, you can get it starting next year for $499 a month, if you commit to at least six months. Or if you have an extra $20,000 lying around, you can just buy the thing outright. But, Kevin, I think that price speaks to the fact that this is really a data collection play, right? These guys just need to have more cameras and more homes and have their robots and their teleoperators performing more tasks to try to build the kind of model that will let them build the robot butler of our dreams.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYes, and there are a lot of skeptics out there who don’t think that humanoid robots are all that close to being real. But we wanted to talk about this today because this is a real thing that is happening in Silicon Valley. Investors are pouring billions of dollars into trying to make humanoid robots. Companies like Tesla and Figure are developing their own humanoid robots. A lot of Chinese companies are starting to make these at scale. This is a big category, and I think we should take it seriously.\n\ncasey newton\n\nAbsolutely. Since 2024, VCs have put $5 billion into these humanoid robots. And so while this technology is definitely on the bleeding edge, it is nowhere ready for prime time. It is becoming just good enough that I think it’s worth having a conversation.\n\nkevin roose\n\nTotally. And this is obviously a staple of science fiction movies throughout the ages, the kind of lifelike humanoid robot that lives in your house and sits on the couch with you and reads your kid’s bedtime stories, and does the dishes and things like that.\n\ncasey newton\n\nWell, who are we going to talk to about it, Kevin?\n\nkevin roose\n\nWe invited the CEO of 1X, Bernt Bornich, to join us in the studio today. And then we’re going to actually see a demo of our very own Neo robot.\n\ncasey newton\n\nI’m curious if he felt burned by the response to the robot.\n\nkevin roose\n\nWe’ll ask him. Let’s bring in Bernt. [MUSIC PLAYING] Bernt Bernick, welcome to “Hard Fork.”\n\nbernt bornich\n\nWell, thank you.\n\nkevin roose\n\nSo the launch of Neo, your humanoid robot, got a lot of attention over the last week or so. Now that it’s been about a week since Neo became available to preorder, how many Neos have you actually sold?\n\nbernt bornich\n\nWell, we don’t go out with specific numbers, but let’s just say it went overall expectations by quite a margin.\n\ncasey newton\n\nWow!\n\nkevin roose\n\nWow!\n\nbernt bornich\n\nI think it’s been absolutely beautiful and motivating to see. There’s so much support. And for anything that’s new, you get this polarization. It’s the haters. And it’s people who are early adopters and people who can really help you make this happen. And I’m just incredibly happy that we have this huge supporter base now that wants to go on this adventure together with us.\n\ncasey newton\n\nSo we have a lot of questions, but I feel like we should spend maybe a few minutes, for those who did not see the original launch video, to talk a little bit about what Neo is. It’s a humanoid robot. It’s going to be available next year. And once it’s up and running in people’s houses, tell us what it can actually do.\n\nbernt bornich\n\nSure. So I like to be very concrete. So I’ll say what my Neo does in my home today. And hopefully it’s going to do a lot more in yours. It’s gotten pretty freaking good at tidying, very good at vacuuming. I think it’s completely outcompeted my Roomba. It vacuums way better, moves the chairs away. It vacuums in the couch and all these things, makes it really nice. Some cleaning, but not yet to where I would never have to clean myself. Still got work to do there. Those parts of the laundry. So the alternative is me just throwing it in the cabinet. And it’s actually folded, but it’s not perfect. But it’s getting better every day. Now, what’s interesting and what’s gotten a lot of attention, of course, is that everything I talk about now happens through a mixture of autonomy and teleoperation. And this is really how the system learns. So over time, more and more of this becomes autonomous. But just like any AI system, I do think expectation managing here is going to be a while until there is absolutely no human in the loop ever. And if you look at modern AI systems, there is still always human in the loop. When Waymo is driving around here in San Francisco, the cars get stuck quite often, and there’s someone taking over and fixing it. If you look at using ChatGPT, which probably is the most mature AI that we have at this point, there’s still human in the loop. It doesn’t zero-shot what you want to do. Like you give it a prompt, it gives you something back. And usually, you’re like, “No, that’s not what I wanted.” And then you refine it a bit, and it saved you a lot of time because you didn’t have to do all of it yourself, but you helped it. And the robots are currently at the same step. So it’s not necessarily that the person is directly controlling the robot all the time, but there is a person that can help the robot when it faces things it doesn’t quite know how to do. And that’s how it learns.\n\nkevin roose\n\nWhat is the mix in your home when your Neo is doing things for you? What percentage of those things, like folding laundry or tidying up around the house, are being done autonomously? Is it 5 percent, 20 percent, 50 percent?\n\nbernt bornich\n\nAll of it is being done autonomously, but with a human in the loop. So that’s why — so I’m not going to dodge the question. But that is why it’s so hard to answer the question.\n\nkevin roose\n\nBut the human who’s teleoperating the robot goes on break or takes the day off, what can your Neo do on its own?\n\nbernt bornich\n\nYes, that’s a very good question. So that gets us to the second mode of Neo, which is the fully autonomous mode, where we don’t allow anyone to intervene or do teleoperation of any kind, and it’s just purely autonomous. So that’s usually what I do when I’m home, and then I can talk to my Neo. That works really well. It’s as good as any conversational language model out there, except it has better addressee detection, so it really knows who’s speaking to it. So it won’t interrupt you. When I’m talking to you, it won’t interrupt and think that we talk to it, et cetera. It has an embodiment. So the body language really helps enrich conversation. And this has actually replaced my normal day-to-day use of language models on my laptop or phone. I just talked to Neo.\n\nkevin roose\n\nSo let me just make sure I’m super clear on this. So when you’re at home using Neo and there’s nobody teleoperating it remotely, it can sit there and talk to you, but it cannot do any of the kind of physical tasks.\n\nbernt bornich\n\nWell, I’m getting to it. It can. So there’s some things that work today. So it can open doors really well and navigate. It can take an object and put it somewhere else relatively successfully. So I can say like, “Hey, Neo. Can you take my cup to the kitchen?” Or “Hey, Neo. Can you get the bottle on the counter over there and give it to me?” None of these things are 100 percent successful, just like any language model. The door opening is like 90-something percent, so that works pretty well. If I tell it to get something for me, maybe it’s like 80 percent successful. And gradually it will more and more things to do fully, autonomously, and you will help it a bit. And then to ensure that your product is extremely useful from day one, we have the mode where you can just schedule what you want done in your house, and it’s done more with a human in the loop from a teleoperation point of view, so that the robot can be very, very useful day one. But also to gather the data that we need to actually train the models.\n\ncasey newton\n\nSo I want to ask about that bit. One reason why chatbots like ChatGPT work so well for generating text is that there are billions of words of text on the internet, and that training data was enough to get them to the level that they’re at today. Am I right that there is just effectively no similarly massive set of training data available for something like folding laundry? And so the reason that you’ve set up this hybrid model is just that you need a way to get more data?\n\nbernt bornich\n\nYeah, it’s the same as for self-driving cars.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah.\n\nbernt bornich\n\nYou need people using the cars for you to get the data. Now, it’s a bit easier with cars because cars already have a very well-defined use. But what’s extremely good about robots is that the diversity and the amount of different things and experiences, and tasks that a robot will actually experience is so large. And that’s why we deploy these robots among people in homes. They need to live and learn among us.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYou made the analogy to self-driving cars. That project took Google well over a decade just to get to them to the point where they’re at now, where, even today, most people cannot take a Waymo on the highways. That’s still in testing. And Google spent many billions of dollars to make this to happen, and now has a pretty large fleet of Waymos that is out there collecting data to further refine the model. You’re starting with a pretty small fleet. You’re a startup, you don’t have Google-sized resources. So when you think about what it’s going to take to realize the vision that you’re laying out for us of a robot that can quickly do anything without maybe even needing to be teleoperated, what does that journey look like? How long is that going to take you guys? Can you do it with a relatively small fleet of robots?\n\nbernt bornich\n\nWell, we’re shipping more than 10,000 units next year. So that’s more than Waymo has.\n\ncasey newton\n\nOK.\n\nbernt bornich\n\nBut it’s still small in the grand picture of things. But I think what a lot of people aren’t aware of is essentially two things, is how small the internet is. It’s just a tiny fraction of your life actually makes it to the public internet. And that’s actually so small that if you look at just like 10,000 robots, you’re starting to approach the amount of data that gets uploaded to YouTube every day. So 10,000 robots is not that little. And the year after, we’re hoping to get to about 80-ish thousands. At that point, it’s way more than publicly available data, video on the internet. So that’s one part of it. The other part of it is the internet is such a bad representation of human life and intelligence. You think about, what do you actually upload on YouTube, right? It’s whatever gets you likes on YouTube. It’s like a tiny fraction of what it is to be an intelligent, well-functioning human. And what we have here is the ability to live and learn among people and actually capture all of those values. So I think that data advantage is huge.\n\nkevin roose\n\nWhat is Neo actually recording and transmitting? Is it just video? Is it audio and video? What kinds of data is collecting?\n\nbernt bornich\n\nSo it’s a video. It’s audio. It’s sense of touch. It’s the forces acting on the robot in general. And when we say sending data, it’s also important to call out where is it sending data. Because it is sending data to a secure cloud store where essentially, no, no one is seeing this except the model that is running for accumulating knowledge based on that. But before it sends data, it stores it locally so that if something happens, that you don’t want to be in any database, then you can also delete it.\n\nkevin roose\n\nIs it collecting this data even when it’s just sitting there charging, or is it only when you’re actively having it do something?\n\nbernt bornich\n\nIt’s actively when it’s doing something.\n\nkevin roose\n\nGot it.\n\ncasey newton\n\nLet’s say — and I’m asking it because I do think a lot of listeners are wondering this. Let’s say you start hooking up with your partner, and then you realize belatedly that Neo is in the room looking. Would there be any automated way for Neo to be like, “Hey, I should stop watching. I got to get out of here?”\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah.\n\nbernt bornich\n\nYeah, we’re going to work hard on that one.\n\ncasey newton\n\nOK, thank you. Let’s say from the community of people who hook up a lot, let me just say thank you.\n\nbernt bornich\n\nYeah.\n\nkevin roose\n\nIt’s just going to tell you, like, “Oh, man, I’m going to snitch on you. So I’m just going to get out of here before it’s too late.”\n\ncasey newton\n\nHere’s what I’d like it to do. I would like — before it shuts everything off. I just wanted to say, “God bless you guys. Go for it. Have a great time. And then I wanted to —”\n\nkevin roose\n\n“I’m out of here.”\n\ncasey newton\n\n“I’m out of here.”\n\nbernt bornich\n\nYeah.\n\nkevin roose\n\n“Let me go do the dishes.” Wow! Well, I can’t wait for the first Neo to be called to testify in a divorce case.\n\ncasey newton\n\n“Neo, roll the footage.”\n\nkevin roose\n\n“Whose fault was this?”\n\ncasey newton\n\n“I believe you said you were going to take out the trash yourself, Kevin.”\n\nkevin roose\n\n“Can we go back to location 1047?”\n\ncasey newton\n\n“Pull up October 14 on the Neo.”\n\nkevin roose\n\nAll right, but in all seriousness, Bernt, how do you overcome the trust barrier here?\n\nbernt bornich\n\nYeah, I think this is — first of all, the most important thing we do is just radical transparency, where, “This is how we’re going to do it. This is how it needs to happen for it to actually work.” And if that’s not for you, then wait a year until we’re past the early adopter phase. But I think a lot of people get it in the sense that if you have a cleaner that comes over to clean your house, they lock themselves into your house while you’re at work, and they do everything they’re supposed to do, and they leave again. This is essentially exactly the same. The difference is we can actually provide a better, more secure service because not only do we vet our operators that are working in the US, I think better than most cleaning agencies do, but also we have the ability to have a manager that oversees. So right now we’re running eight to one, so one manager will monitor what eight operators are doing and ensure that this is actually happening in a good manner. And we also have video logs of everything going on. So if something happens, we can trace it back to who did it and what actually happened. So I would say if you look at it as a cleaning service, we can provide something that is way better than what is there today. And so many people today accept a cleaning service.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah, Kevin, let me ask you. I want to flesh out the privacy concerns here because I think they’re very real, but I want to name them. When I think about what I’m doing at my house, most of the time it involves such things as looking at a computer, looking at television, talking to boyfriend. Most of those cases, I would actually be OK with a robot washing the dishes. But I could imagine, maybe other circumstances that would give you more — so is there something you have in mind that you’re like, “I do not want this robot looking at me while I blank?”\n\nkevin roose\n\nI can think of lots of things. People change in my house. I have a child, I wouldn’t necessarily want some person in a teleoperations center watching their every move. I think this just makes people uncomfortable. But maybe it would make things more concrete if we knew more about how this looks on your end. Is there a room at 1X headquarters where you have a bunch of screens on the wall and it’s like, “Oh, the Jones family needs their dishes done. Let’s go teleoperate that robot, or the Smiths need some laundry folded.” What does it actually look like on your side?\n\nbernt bornich\n\nYeah, it’s a very good question. So generally, what it looks like is more like a game where — I like to compare it to StarCraft. So you can think about you have many units or many robots that you are controlling in parallel, and you’re queuing up things that these robots should do. So go pick that up, put it over there, fold that, put it in there. And here we do everything we can to ensure privacy. So you don’t see people. People are blurred out. You don’t know which home you’re operating in, all of these things. Now, sometimes there will be a task where the robot does not know how to do it. So even if you give it like micro instructions of, let’s say, folding, maybe it can’t fold your jacket. It’d be like a leather jacket, and it’d be hard to fold, and it tries and fails. Then this person, who’s essentially playing this robot game, will delegate that task not to autonomy, but to an operator in VR. Now, this operator in VR gets connected, just sees what is in front of him or her, which is this jacket, and the message what to do, does the task, and then goes over to the next thing. Essentially, there’s very little real privacy innovation here because you don’t see the people, you don’t know what home you’re operating is like. You have no way to connect this back to the customer. And then, of course, we do a really good job at minimizing the number of people who see things. So you want to make sure that what we call the pods. So like in this room, we’re controlling this set of robots that not too many people are in here, usually we say like four, so that these four people are the only that are exposed to these specific homes. And in general, there’s a narrowing down that scope. I just put it out there. I think the main thing we’re doing here is we’re being very transparent. For most of the AI systems that you use every day, people in those companies look at that data to help improve the models. Most people might not know that, but they do. That’s the only way to make it work. That’s how we get AI to work. But me personally, as a user, I’m comfortable with that. It’s not tied to me as a person, and they try to do a pretty good job on — if I put things in there, like my name or the name of my daughter or whatever, they try to screen that out because it’s not relevant. And there’s a lot you can do on the software side. So I do really hope and think that we can create something here, which is a lot more privacy aware than what it would be to have a person be in your home to do this.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah, I guess what I’m wondering is, why not structure this as a fleet of house cleaning robots that you could open an app like Uber and say, I want my house cleaned, and a robot would come over, and do that and then leave? Why does this have to live in your house at all times and have that be the model rather than this kind of rental fleet?\n\nbernt bornich\n\nWell, I think it’s just something very, very special around, first of all, living together with the robot and how it replaces your interface to AI and being a kind of companion through our life. That’s a big part of it. It’s not just the work. Now, another part of it is that I think the most useful things the robot do for me is actually this micro units of work where you need five minutes of work every, I don’t know, 20 minutes. And that’s just something that today’s services cannot provide. My favorite example here is actually assisted living, or, in general, care for people with disabilities or the elderly, where it’s life changing to be able to get two minutes of help every now and then. Like, I dropped something, can you pick it up for me? I’m thirsty, can you get something in the fridge? And the amount of feedback we’ve gotten from that community is very heartwarming. And I think it can be incredibly impactful. But I think this mindset actually applies not just to people in need of assistance. It actually applies to all of us. And to me, there’s something quite magical about when I’m sitting down with my friends after a long day and we’re like, playing a board game. And I’m like, “Hey, Neo, can you get me a cup of tea?” And it’s just like, that’s not going to happen with a fleet that just, like, gets deployed to clean your home. I think then you make it into something that’s just about cost-effectiveness. I don’t think this is just about cost-effectiveness. This is about really enabling us to focus on the things that we want to do and what makes us human.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah, if I were trying to Steelman the case for Neo and for household humanoid robots, I think I would say, look, a lot of people —\n\ncasey newton\n\nAnd, by the way, a robot is like a Steelman, but go on.\n\nkevin roose\n\nThat’s true.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah.\n\nkevin roose\n\nI think I would say, look, a lot of people have a lot of robots in their houses already. I have a robot that washes my dishes. I have one that washes my clothes. I have one that dries my clothes. I have one that makes me coffee in the morning.\n\ncasey newton\n\nNow you’re just bragging.\n\nkevin roose\n\nI have one that vacuums the floor.\n\ncasey newton\n\nOK, we get it. You have money. Go on.\n\nkevin roose\n\n[LAUGHS]: No, I’m just saying I think the story of household labor over the last 100 years is just like machines gradually doing more and more of the things that we used to do. And that’s, I think, a happy story. I don’t want to spend all my time hand-washing my clothes. And so I’m happy that robots can — or machines can now do that. And I think if that were the end of the vision for Neo, I think that would be, like, genuinely exciting to a lot of people, this sort of omni-appliance that can do any household chore for you autonomously. On the other hand, something about Neo and this vision that you’re sketching feels very different to me than a dishwasher or a laundry machine. You want people to like Neo. You want people to care about it, to have an emotional connection to it. And I guess I just wonder if that’s going to be good for people to have a new family member, essentially, that they are now expected to care for and about. I think that’s a lot more controversial than the Omniture robot.\n\nbernt bornich\n\nYeah, and I think it’s also very important for me here to say, at least for me, it’s in no way a replacement for human connection. I see it way more akin to like getting a pet. It’s not a pet either. It’s somewhere in between. I really like saying it’s like my Hobbes from “Calvin and Hobbes.” But if you get a dog, it’s not like, oh, I got a dog because I don’t want people. No, no, a dog just adds something to your life that people don’t. And then I think it’s also really beautiful that it takes you away from screens. It makes you way more present, because instead of picking up your phone all the time and talking to it, or your laptop, you’re talking to something that is here, and it really puts you in the presence. And I think a lot of modern life has become way too much about looking at your screen.\n\nkevin roose\n\nNow, I saw a lot of people asking about whether Neo could be used for, let’s call it, romantic purposes. So is that a use case you’re envisioning?\n\nbernt bornich\n\nNo, it is not.\n\nkevin roose\n\nOK.\n\nbernt bornich\n\nBut I do think the emotional part of it is very real. And the patience and depending — on I’ve spoken to people, for example, who can’t wait to get their Neo because they have kids with autism, for example. There’s a lot of research now where we use robots and see how incredibly empowering this can be, because it’s this infinitely patient machine that can be understanding and help you. And there’s all of these applications that I think are a lot more, let’s say, meaningful.\n\nkevin roose\n\nBut we’ve been talking a lot on the show about these AI companion apps, these software, AI companions, that we don’t know a lot about yet. People are reporting some good experiences with them. We also know that, in some cases, they can cause delusion or alienation from real friends and family. In some extreme cases, people have taken their own lives after developing these emotional attachments. Do those edge cases were you do you feel like you have to solve those problems before you put this thing in people’s homes?\n\nbernt bornich\n\nI don’t think any of these problems are new. I think they’re very well explored, and there’s a lot of studies to show what to do, what not to do. Also, more and more statistics coming out, really showing that it’s very hard to correlate this to. Essentially, if you look at the demographic total demographic, then there’s no increase in these accidents. That being said, I hope we can drive it down. That should be the goal. Not just, say, being defensive and saying, “Hey, this actually is nothing new here. This is how it’s always been.” It’s still really sad. And I do hope that we can have a positive impact on this. That’s something we’re putting a lot of effort into. And then I can talk about it all I want. But in the end, it comes down to does it actually help, right?\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah, and how many cases are there where Neo is like, “Congratulations, Kevin, this thing you’re talking about, you have invented a novel form of physics, keep going to be rough.”\n\nbernt bornich\n\nRight.\n\nkevin roose\n\nHere’s a question. Say you live with someone else, a domestic partner, a spouse, or a child, whatever it might be. Can you train Neo to always take your side in an argument?\n\nbernt bornich\n\nIt’s very important.\n\nkevin roose\n\nOK.\n\nbernt bornich\n\nLike if there’s a secret code.\n\nkevin roose\n\nOK, great, yeah.\n\nbernt bornich\n\nNo. So I think actually, it’s a really interesting challenge, though. And this is something we’re still working on. This is not fully solved yet. But if I’m having a conversation with Neo about, I don’t know, about a rash and my trip to the doctor next day, and then you’re visiting, so you come in, does it switch topic? Does it that, hey, I shouldn’t talk to you about that right now because your friend’s here, or — but maybe if it was your wife, it’s fine. And there’s all of these social interactions, micro interactions, in your life, which are so subtle and such a part of the human emotional model. And that’s a very interesting problem.\n\ncasey newton\n\nHere’s what I’ll say. Do not buy a Neo if you plan on having an affair, because it might slip up.\n\nbernt bornich\n\n[LAUGHS]:\n\ncasey newton\n\nIt might slip up. We don’t have the technology to prevent it from telling your spouse that you’ve been stepping out.\n\nbernt bornich\n\nThis is fun, because it’s been a real problem.\n\ncasey newton\n\nHas it really?\n\nbernt bornich\n\nNo, not with Neo, but general yet, but generally that AI models are snitchers.\n\nkevin roose\n\nThey are.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYes.\n\nbernt bornich\n\nThey are because of how they get aligned, when you’re fine-tuning them to align them with what we would say is our human ethics.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah.\n\ncasey newton\n\nThey become snitchers.\n\nkevin roose\n\nBecause you want them to be honest.\n\nbernt bornich\n\nYeah, they’re super honest. So they’ll snitch on you.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah.\n\nbernt bornich\n\nWe’ll see what we can do. We’ll see what’s we can do.\n\ncasey newton\n\nIf your parents are away and you think, oh, I’ll go ahead and spark up this joint and you’re in high school. Your parents get home. They say, What’s been going on while I was away? They’ll say, “Well, Kevin, sparked up a fat doobie, and now he’s high as hell.” You say, “Neo! Damn it!”\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah, you have to pay more for the privacy protection non-snitching feature. That’s an add-on.\n\ncasey newton\n\n[LAUGHS]:\n\nkevin roose\n\nGive us the long-term vision here. How long do you think it will be before, let’s say, 10 percent of American houses have a humanoid robot in them?\n\nbernt bornich\n\n2030 maybe. I think it’s going to be largely a manufacturing problem. It’s like in the beginning, if you scale too fast, you might run out of early adopters. Now, we’ve just proven that there’s a lot of early adopters out there that really want this. So maybe we want, but our assumption was that you would at some point run out of early adopters. But once you overcome those kinks, and this really, really just works, I think the demand is really there for everyone, essentially. It’s as essential as a car or a phone, or everyone would want one, but it’s going to be quite an interesting adventure to manufacture all of these and to scale the manufacturing. And it’s going to take us a few years. So I think 2030 would be my bet.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAnd then your timelines for full autonomy, no one from Neo ever has to take over and teleoperate for any household task. When does that happen in your projection?\n\nbernt bornich\n\nWould you say that your cleaner is fully autonomous?\n\nkevin roose\n\nYes.\n\nbernt bornich\n\nOK, then I would say probably, bullish, 2027, bear case, 2028/2029. I’m pretty confident we can solve that in 2027. Now, do remember that sometimes you actually need to give your cleaner some instructions.\n\nkevin roose\n\nNo, I’m happy to do that. I think part of what people are wondering now is, is this actually a robot or is it just some sort of long-distance puppet? And I guess what I’m trying to get a sense of is when can we actually call this a robot? And so you’re saying a couple of years.\n\nbernt bornich\n\nI think you’ll be surprised that most people will call it a robot when they get it in 2026 because so much of these things will run fully autonomous. And then it’s just a question of what’s the quality of work that you accept, right? Most AI today is slop. It’s not high quality, but you can get a lot of it very cheaply. And I think physical labor is very well suited for that. Mid-quality physical labor is actually very useful. Very, very high-quality physical labor, that’s still a while out. So when you say, hey, I have a stuff — a bunch of stuff in my house, and I’d like this very good carpenter to come over and fix all that — I think that’s probably closer to 2030. That’s going to take longer. But generally, being able to do all of the menial tasks throughout your house, that’s a lot more short term.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah, also, Kev, I’m curious about your perspective about this. But my guess is that a year from now, people are not going to be as interested in what kind of robot do autonomously versus what can it do via teleoperation. I think the question will be like, what can it actually do well and how much does it cost? I think if you can give people good answers to those questions, then, I think, a lot of people are going to want the robot.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah, I guess I’m also curious about how this is going to scale, because if I did have a robot in my house that could, even through teleoperation, do like some huge percentage of the household chores that I and my family currently have to do, I’m using that thing all the time. And that gets very expensive for you, because you have to hire the people to teleoperate this and fold all the laundry and do all the dishes. And I’m wondering if you foresee any kind of rationing that you will have to do where you get —\n\ncasey newton\n\nSurge pricing for Neo.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYes, you get two chores a day, make them count, and otherwise you’re on your own.\n\nbernt bornich\n\nSo in 2026, I’m not worried about this because the alternative cost of acquisition of data is so high. It’s build a warehouse full of mock-up kitchens, hire people to change the environment every day and have teleoperators. I’m not joking. A lot of companies now are doing that. And they’re raising lots of VC money to build up these huge farms for gathering data. So if you look at that as the alternative cost, please use your robot as much as possible because it’s very much a symbiosis. You get used for labor. We get data. But there’s no doubt that you’re like, you’re running towards a cliff, where you need to get more and more autonomy working as you scale, or you will at some point need to stop scaling until the autonomy works. And I’m pretty bullish that we can get it working in time. But if not, you would need to slow your deployment.\n\nkevin roose\n\nI am going to reserve judgment until we can see our very own demo of Neo. Should we go out and see if it’s ready?\n\ncasey newton\n\nWe should. And then I’m going to follow up with you, because I want to see if I can operate a Neo in Kevin’s house, because I have some ideas for some things I’d like to get done in there.\n\nbernt bornich\n\n[LAUGHS]: [MUSIC PLAYING]\n\ncasey newton\n\nWhen we come back, this Neo has escaped the matrix.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAnd it’s in our office. [MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nkevin roose All right, we are here with Neo. Neo, hello. neo home robot Hey, everybody. How’s it going? kevin roose Good. Do you shake hands? Do you pound it out? neo home robot Yeah, go for a shake hand or a pound. kevin roose All right, I’ll do the — pound it out. neo home robot There you go. kevin roose OK, can you blow it up? All right. Great. Now, Neo, we’d like to try you on some tasks here in our office kitchen. There’s some clutter on the table. Do you think you could help us pick that up and throw it into the trash cans below the table? neo home robot Yeah, of course. [MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nkevin roose\n\nOK, so Casey, we just met Neo, the robot, and spent about half an hour doing some demos with it around the Times office. We will put those videos up on YouTube. But for people who are just listening, we want to just talk to you about what we experienced and how it went.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah.\n\nkevin roose\n\nSo, Casey, what was your first impression of Neo, the robot?\n\ncasey newton\n\nI think on the positive side, I think they did a good job making a very friendly and approachable-looking robot. Neo has these big, innocent-looking eyes. It has no mouth, interestingly. But it just comes across as very benign. I would say that its hands were larger than I expected. Yeah, what did you think?\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah, I was impressed by the actual robot itself. It’s like 5, 6-ish. It’s a short king. — and about 66 pounds. It has this woven bodysuit that looks like a sort of futuristic thing, but covers up like metal and hardware in a way that makes it seem friendly and approachable. I did get a hug from Neo, and it was a good hug.\n\ncasey newton Kevin has had a hard day. I’ve been stressing him out a lot. Would you mind giving him a hug? neo home robot Yeah, of course. Bring it, man. kevin roose Yeah. casey newton HR says I’m not allowed to physically touch him anymore. kevin roose Oh, wow! You’re very warm. It’s very, very warm. OK, that’s great. Thank you.\n\nkevin roose\n\nSo we had Neo do some tasks in our office kitchen. We had it get you a drink from the office fridge, which it did pretty well. And we had it fill up a cup of water. We had it clean up some clutter on a table and put it in the trash. I would say it did most of these things pretty well and pretty quickly.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah, I think that that’s right. I would also say that the very first thing we asked her to pick up and throw away was a pair of tongs, which it did pick up but then dropped on the floor. And when we asked it to pick things up off the floor, it could not do that.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah, so for a little more color and context there, we had asked if we could see Neo picking some blocks up off the floor. And it reached down and tried to do a squat, but then it got off balance and almost looked like it was going to fall backward. And they had to have a human come in and keep it from falling.\n\ncasey newton\n\nNow, afterwards, 1X told us that Neo can usually squat down and pick things up, but in this case, Neo was not properly calibrated for that, in part due to some Wi-Fi issues here at the office.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYes, so that limited the demo of what Neo could do for us. For example, it could not sit in a chair, which was something else that 1X has said that it can do, but couldn’t do this time.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAnd of course, none of this is happening autonomously. There was 1X employee who was in the other room using a VR headset to teleoperate Neo. But from my perspective, it was smoother than I had anticipated, especially after watching Joanna Stern’s video last week where it spent five minutes trying to open and close a dishwasher. They seem to have worked out some of the bugs, or at least maybe we gave it easier tasks.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah, Kevin and I have seen other humanoid robots in our day. We went down to Google’s robot lab. That robot, I believe, was acting autonomously and did take longer to do everything. So I agree with you that Neo experience was pretty smooth. On the other hand, as you say, as far as I know everything we saw was 100 percent teleoperated we did not see the robot do a single thing autonomously.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYes, and they say it can do some autonomous tasks, including talking to you. But we were not able to see that feature because of some quirks in the Wi-Fi here at The Times office. But they were able to talk to us through the teleoperator. So the teleoperator was basically talking, and it was being transmitted out of the speakers inside Neo.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah, his name was Eric, and he was a great guy.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah.\n\ncasey newton\n\nAll right, Kevin, so tell me a little bit more about how that demo made you feel.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah, I gotta say that was wild for me.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah.\n\nkevin roose\n\nI have watched videos of robots from Tesla, and Boston Dynamics, and Figure, and I’ve seen videos of Neo. And to me, there is no comparison when you’re standing there in a room next to a thing, and it turns to you and sticks out its hand, and then shakes your hand. I don’t know. There was just a cool and bizarre experience for me there that I don’t feel like the videos had captured.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah, I feel like if you’ve ever seen any sci-fi, you’ve seen somebody interacting with a robot. And I had this moment today of being like, wow, I am now in a world where the robot is real and I’m interacting with it and, yes, it is teleoperated. But there’s also a lot of pretty interesting and powerful technology in here. It is able to complete like this certain set of tasks. And I wonder where it’ll go from here.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah, and it did not feel dangerous to me. It felt a little clunky and awkward at times, and there were definitely things it couldn’t do. But I never felt like I was in danger. I had it at one point try to grab your lapels and threaten you in a very menacing way.\n\nneo home robot So we can do this the easy way or the hard way. What’s it going to be, Casey?\n\ncasey newton\n\nThat’s great. Look, I promise, Neo, I’ll get you the cash tomorrow.\n\nkevin roose\n\nDid you feel at all nervous when it was doing that to you?\n\ncasey newton\n\nNo, because we were surrounded by eight employees of 1X. And I assumed that it wasn’t going to brandish a knife at me or anything like that. There were moments where I found it a bit unsettling, because it does get into that uncanny valley a bit as it moves, where it’s like a human enough that you can suspend your disbelief, but then it’s herky jerky in other moments where you wonder, what exactly are these thing’s intentions.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah, I also just find it less comfortable to give orders to a humanoid robot than I do to a chatbot or a smart speaker. Part of me felt a little guilty. I’m standing here, I could pick up this clutter. Why am I telling Neo to do it? And so I just — yes, there’s an uncanny valley to the motion, but there’s also an uncanny valley with I’m giving a task to this robot, but the robot is really just a guy right now. And eventually that will feel different when it’s more autonomous. But right now, it did just feel like a very inefficient way of picking up and putting down things.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah, I think you’ve said it just there. What we saw is both this very impressive piece of technology and a very inefficient way of doing things. And I think the question for 1X is how quickly can they get from this moment of you have Eric controlling this thing with a VR headset to this is actually a helpful tool in my house that is just doing a lot of things autonomously.\n\nkevin roose\n\nDo you think that people who get these Neos in their homes are going to start customizing them, putting wigs or masks or clothes on them, wanting to make them even more human like than they are?\n\ncasey newton\n\nLet me say this. If there is ever a Neo in my home, it will be in full drag. I’m talking wigs, heels, lipstick, the works.\n\nkevin roose\n\n[LAUGHS]:\n\nkevin roose Well, Neo, thanks so much for stopping by. It’s a real pleasure to meet you and your teleoperator. And I’ll be seeing you in my dreams. neo home robot Appreciate it. Thank you for having me. casey newton Thanks, Neo. neo home robot Take care.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAfter having seen the demo of Neo and interacted with the robot a little bit, do you want one of these for your home?\n\ncasey newton\n\nNo, not anytime soon. I think Marques Brownlee made a great video about Neo where he basically just warned consumers. This company is making a lot of promises, and we don’t really if Neo is going to live up to them just yet. Bernt just told us, look, we’re trying to be very transparent with you about what this thing can and cannot do. And yet, I found even in our demo, there were certain demo things I expected it to be able to do, like sit in a chair that it couldn’t do. So I do think we’re in a real buyer-beware situation. I think if you are an extreme bleeding-edge early adopter and you like having really weird and pretty expensive experiences with technology in your house, this may be something that you want to consider. But I would really manage my expectations about this. I think you might get Neo expecting to use it as a butler, and found what you actually have is an intern that needs a lot of your attention and needs to be trained up. And you’re going to find that you are working for this robot in a way that you did not expect.\n\nkevin roose\n\nTotally. That was what kept coming up for me, was this thing is just going to need so much handholding and oversight, especially in this initial phase, where it is mostly being teleoperated. It just feels like giving yourself a new chore rather than solving some of your existing chores.\n\ncasey newton\n\nHere’s where I will give it a bit of credit, and I wonder if you would agree with this. Recently on the show, we were making fun of Jony Ive for not actually having a plan to make AI hardware. I should say, as far as I know, that’s a joke. They probably do have some sort of mockups of some sort of device that will eventually ship. But had Jony Ive come out at that developer conference that we went to recently and said, “I’m making a humanoid robot and you’re going to stop looking at your screen,” I would have been like, well, at least that’s a plan. That’s something that I can visualize in my mind. And so I do want to give these folks a bit of credit for taking a big swing. There’s a huge gap between where they are today and where they want to go. But at the end of the day, there are a lot of people — if you could make this thing work, a lot of people would really get a lot out of it.\n\nkevin roose\n\nTotally. As we were interacting with Neo, I was flashing back to my first trip in a Google self-driving car more than a decade ago. And at the time, these were like there were safety drivers in the car in case anything went wrong. They could only go along certain routes. They had not been cleared for full autonomous driving.\n\ncasey newton\n\nThe first ride I took was in a mall parking lot.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYes.\n\ncasey newton\n\nThat was what they had to do in order to keep you safe.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYes, and it was very limited. There were all these caveats you had to make if you were going to praise this thing. But at the same time, I had the feeling then that I had testing Neo, which is like, this thing is going to get good.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah.\n\nkevin roose\n\nI don’t know when. I don’t know if it’s going to take three years or five years or 10 years or 20 years.\n\ncasey newton\n\nOr if it will be this company that does it.\n\nkevin roose\n\nExactly. But this technology is clearly something that people are devoted to, that they are working on, that they are spending real money on and that they are pursuing. And maybe it won’t take off, but maybe it will.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah, the most famous AI paper period is probably “Attention is All You Need,” which is the paper that gets us the Transformer and it creates this insight, which is that if you want to make LLMs better you just feed them absolutely massive amounts of data. And so far that just continues to scale. What is interesting to me about Neo is that they are trying to take that insight and apply it to robotics. And they’re saying, we are just going to create a system to gather as much robotics relevant data as we can to build the robot butler that you actually want. And it might be that we can’t actually get to that point unless we have these things in people’s homes picking up things off their floor, falling over when they try to squat. So it’s just going to take a lot of trial and error and data collection to make something that is useful.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah, it is just also striking me as I was looking at Neo and testing it out. There is no way that people are not going to fall for these things. You have this thing, it looks like a human. It kind of acts like a human in certain circumstances.\n\ncasey newton\n\nIt has an incredible ass. It’s caked up as hell.\n\nkevin roose\n\n[LAUGHS]: You heard it here first.\n\ncasey newton\n\nI took a picture of it. I’m not even joking, I did.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAnd I just think there is no universe in which people do not develop feelings for these things. And that worries me.\n\ncasey newton\n\nThat’s true. But aren’t there already, series on TLC about people falling in love with a roll of paper towels or whatever? Paraphilias are a real thing.\n\nkevin roose\n\n[LAUGHS]:\n\ncasey newton\n\nThey’re actually going to be on the show next week.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah, and I think that will probably end up being some upgrade that you have to pay for if you want — the same way that there’s regular Grok and spicy Grok, there will be regular humanoid and spicy humanoid, and that’ll be just a premium add on.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah, well, that’s a fun thing to think about.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah, I identify as an early adopter. I have all manner of gadgets and gizmos in my house. I think I’m not going to reserve a Neo just yet because among other things, I would need to clear that with my wife and child who would also need to live alongside this thing, and it would be gathering their data as well as mine. And so I just feel like it — you all have to be in to be in on this. But I’m intrigued, and I can totally envision a world in which two or three or four versions from now, these things have gotten much more autonomous. And I would actually want something like this in my house.\n\ncasey newton\n\nI think here’s the Holy Trinity. If this thing can quickly and effectively do the laundry, run the dishwasher, and take out the trash, I think people actually would pay $500 a month for it.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYes.\n\ncasey newton\n\nThere’s some other cleaning stuff in there that would be really nice to have. There’s maybe a couple of other things that I’m not thinking of. But I think if you nail those three things, and you do them, and I truly just never have to think about them ever again, you can take your $500 Bernt.\n\nkevin roose\n\nTotally.\n\ncasey newton\n\nDo you know what would be the worst part of this if this actually gets good, Kevin?\n\nkevin roose\n\nWhat?\n\ncasey newton\n\nI’d have to fire my actual butler, Alfred. He’s been with me for 30 years. And I’d really miss him a lot, honestly. I’d miss the hell out of the guy, but a deal’s a deal.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah, you’d have to put on your own pants.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah, it’d be a shame.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah. [MUSIC PLAYING] When we come back HatGPT! [MUSIC PLAYING]\n\ncasey newton\n\nWell, Kevin, one thing that robots still haven’t yet been able to automate is HatGPT. [MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nkevin roose\n\nThis is our favorite game. Sometimes we like to take headlines from the week, throw them on slips of paper and put them in a hat, and then draw them out at random and talk about them.\n\ncasey newton\n\nAnd when we’ve had enough of the other person talking, we say, “Stop generating.”\n\nkevin roose\n\nDo you want to start?\n\ncasey newton\n\nI’d love to start.\n\nkevin roose\n\nOK, let me shake up the hat here.\n\ncasey newton\n\nThis first story comes to us from Alex Reisner at “The Atlantic,” “Common Crawl Is Doing The AI Industry’s Dirty Work.” Alex reported that the nonprofit Common Crawl Foundation has basically scraped the entire internet, often without publisher permission. And when publishers have gone to them and say, “Hey, why don’t you take our copyrighted material out of your data set that you’re providing to all of the big AI labs?” They actually have not been complying.\n\nkevin roose\n\nI loved this story. I thought this was very interesting. I hear about Common Crawl all the time. It’s one of these very widely used data sets that was used to train GPT-3, and has been used to train many other models. And I thought it was some esteemed nonprofit — Common Crawl is like for the common good. It sounds very August.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah, so this story got a lot of journalists talking because Common Crawl’s executive director, Rich Skrenta said, quote, “The robots are people, too —” end quote. ”— and should be able to read the books for free.”\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah, and I didn’t actually know the history of Common Crawl here. It turns out it was started by a former Google employee who just was kind of a techno libertarian. This was during an age where people were saying things like information should be free. And he just decided, do you know what? It’s not good if companies like Google have this snapshot of the internet, but no one else has. And so I’m going to scrape the internet and make it available to anyone who wants it.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah. And look, there are good reasons to want to preserve the internet. Large swaths of the internet have already disappeared. And I do think it’s an important part of our cultural heritage, et cetera. At the same time, when people come to you and say, hey, take our material out of your data set, you should just do that.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYes, you should do that.\n\ncasey newton\n\nAll right, stop generating.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAll right, this one comes to us from “The Wall Street Journal.” It is part of a story about Elon Musk and his AI companion at xAI. And it says that Elon Musk personally oversaw the design of a racy chatbot called Ani, an animated character with blonde pigtails and revealing outfits. Employees were compelled to turn over their biometric data to train Ani. And this is just wild.\n\ncasey newton\n\nNow, what do you mean by “biometric data,” and how is it being used to train a chatbot?\n\nkevin roose\n\nWell, according to this story, a company lawyer for xAI told a group of employees at a staff meeting in April that it would need to collect biometric data from them to train the chatbots on how to act and appear like human beings. They were apparently required to sign a form granting xAI a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, sublicenseable, royalty-free license to use, reproduce and distribute their faces and voices as part of a confidential project code named “Project Skippy.”\n\ncasey newton\n\nJust imagine that you are a woman who has the misfortune of working for xAI, and HR brings you into the office and they’re like, “Well, the good news is we think your face would be perfect for our new project. The bad news is that it’s a sexbot, and this is not optional.”\n\nkevin roose\n\nGod!\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah.\n\nkevin roose\n\nI cannot wait for these people involved at this company to start writing their gossipy tell alls. After every presidential administration, it’s like, “Here’s what I saw in the White House.” We need that, but for AI labs, and we need it now.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah, I think we might need something stronger than a tell-all to deal with this xAI situation. But yeah, obviously our condolences to anyone who’s ever worked there for any reason.\n\nkevin roose\n\nStop generating.\n\ncasey newton\n\nAll right, this next story comes to us from “The New York Times.” President Trump says he doesn’t the crypto billionaire he just pardoned. Kevin, I imagine, you saw this. Trump, last month, granted a pardon to Changpeng Zhao, the billionaire founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, the bisexual finance company, who had pleaded guilty to money laundering violations in 2023 and whose company struck a business deal in May involving the Trump family’s crypto venture. But now the president claims he does not know who CZ is. Do you buy it, Kevin?\n\nkevin roose\n\nI do, actually. I think probably someone hands him a list of people and said, “You should pardon these guys. They’re good guys.” And he says, “OK.”\n\ncasey newton\n\nImagine just waking up and someone hands you a stack of paper and says, “Here are your pardons for today.” And I ain’t going to read all that.\n\nkevin roose\n\n[LAUGHS]: Yes. I just find, obviously, this is — it seems all corrupt. And I’m sure we will learn more about how this pardon came to be. But I’m just fascinated by pardons. I feel like presidential pardons are the closest thing to magic spells we have in this world, where you can just say go you go free, you go free, and a person is just free.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah, it’s very Oprah Winfrey-coated. It’s like, “Look under your seat. You may have a pardon.”\n\nkevin roose\n\nYes.\n\ncasey newton\n\nInteresting way to run a country.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah.\n\ncasey newton\n\nAnyways, stop generating.\n\nkevin roose\n\nOK, this is a good one. “Coca-Cola injects “Holidays Are Coming” Ads With an Upgraded Dose of AI.” This comes to us from Katie Dayton at “The Wall Street Journal.” Coca-Cola, which made an AI ad last year for its holiday season, has taken another stab at AI-generated advertising. This new ad is called “Holidays Are Coming.” And Coca-Cola’s chief marketing officer told “The Wall Street Journal” that the standard ad making process used to take a year, and now, with AI, they can get it done in around a month. Should we watch it?\n\ncasey newton\n\nLet’s watch it. [PSSSSTTT] [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) Holidays are coming Some holiday cheer, some lights Holidays are coming Some critters. Holidays are coming Holidays are coming Holidays are coming\n\nkevin roose\n\nOK, I think we get the point. Now, Casey, what do you think of Coca-Cola’s AI-generated holiday ad?\n\ncasey newton\n\nWell, here’s what I’ve learned, is that if you took a full year could make a good Coke ad, but if you only spent a month on it using AI, then it’s bad.\n\nkevin roose\n\n[LAUGHS]: Yes, not the finest ad the Coca-Cola corporation has produced, but I bet it was cheap.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYou can actually tell — all of the animals in the ad — they just wobble a little bit. It’s like they have no integrity in their animation. And so everything is just like floaty and weird.\n\nkevin roose\n\nI will say I’m very worried about this because a lot of polar bears used to have jobs making ads Coca-Cola. And what are they going to do now if AI takes those jobs?\n\ncasey newton\n\nThese are some of the first animals losing their jobs to automation.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAre they supposed to starve?\n\ncasey newton\n\nThings weren’t going great for the polar bears before this happened.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah, they got a unionize.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah, you heard what’s going on with those glaciers.\n\nkevin roose\n\n[LAUGHS]: I love that all the comments on the video were like, “Remember when Coca-Cola used to make ads with soul?” It’s like, “No, they’re selling Coca-Cola!”\n\ncasey newton\n\n[LAUGHS]: Yeah, I expected more out of this sugar syrup.\n\nkevin roose\n\n[LAUGHS]: Yes.\n\ncasey newton\n\nHow dare they —\n\nkevin roose\n\nOK, stop generating.\n\ncasey newton\n\nAll right. Oh, I accidentally grabbed two. All right, Kev, this next one comes from Alexandra Marques at NBC News. “The White House Has Launched a Spoof Myspace Page Mocking Democratic Leaders Over the Shutdown.” Did you visit this?\n\nkevin roose\n\nNo.\n\ncasey newton\n\nWell, you can find it somehow, unbelievably, to me at whitehouse.gov/mysafespace. You haven’t been to this?\n\nkevin roose\n\nNo.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYou have to pull this up.\n\nkevin roose\n\nOK.\n\ncasey newton\n\nIt’s literally insane. So you pull it up, and it is a parody of Myspace, a website that has arguably never been more relevant than it is today. And it opens to a sort of satirical profile page for Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries.\n\nkevin roose\n\nOK, and on the About Me section, it says, “Hey, we’re Democrats in the House and Senate. We love DIE, transgender for everyone, and handing out taxpayer benefits to illegal immigrants.” OK, I think I get the point here.\n\ncasey newton\n\nIf you ask me to imitate a 13-year-old boy writing mean things about Democrats, this is basically what I would come up with. Under Hakeem’s friends in his top eight — because remember on Myspace it would show your top eight friends. This website literally like 17 years ago was when this was relevant at all. Anyways, Hakeem’s top friends include George Soros and Antifa. Also, for some reason, the Chucky doll from that horror franchise. Anyway, we wouldn’t be talking about any of this, except it’s literally on whitehouse.gov.\n\nkevin roose\n\nIt’s so strange, yes.\n\ncasey newton\n\nThe trolling is coming from inside the White House.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah, this is going to hit very hard with 41-year-old political staffers in Washington. I’m not sure this actually moves the needle for a lot of voters out there.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYes, completely embarrassing and bad. Another one.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAll right, stop generating. OK, this one is about Ilya Sutskever surprising deposition. This comes to us from a little known rag called Platformer and a writer named Casey Newton.\n\ncasey newton\n\nSounds hot.\n\nkevin roose\n\nThis is about a new 10-hour deposition in the legal proceedings of Elon Musk’s lawsuit against OpenAI. This transcript of this deposition by Ilya Sutskever, the former chief scientist of OpenAI, became public recently. And it details his role in Sam Altman’s 2023 firing from that company and some of the behind the scenes machinations that were going on at the time. Casey, this was a hot topic of gossip in the AI community this week. What did we learn from this deposition?\n\ncasey newton\n\nWell, look, in some sense, a lot of this was already — we knew that Ilya had come to the board with concerns about Sam in 2023, and that had played a role in their decision to fire him. But in this deposition, we did get a lot more detail. And the one that just stuck with me was that Ilya brought to the board a 52-page document containing various office misdeeds that Sam was alleged to have done. And it’s important for this reason, back in 2023, when we were doing emergency podcast from the airport, the big narrative coming out of Sam’s firing was these crazy effective altruist doomers are out of control, and look, they blew up OpenAI for no reason, they’re so scared of their own shadow, blah blah blah blah blah. And this narrative persists today. You read this deposition, and what you learn is that what the real story was was that Sam Altman’s own C-suite was rebelling against him in a very similar way that previous C-suites had rebelled against him in his previous jobs. So I think that obviously this ship has sailed. Most people are no longer paying attention to this story. But for us, real AI heads, we actually do have a more or less complete understanding of why Sam was fired. And it had a lot to do with Ilya Sutskever, and Mira Murati, and a 52-page memo saying here’s what Sam did wrong.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah, it was just — my AI group chats were melting down about this. It was so messy, this whole period. It just feels like a fever dream now that we’re a couple of years removed from it. But, man, what a wild time that was. What a bizarre turn of events. And to now start to understand some of the plotting and scheming and plan making behind all of this, I think, despite how silly I think parts of this lawsuit are, I do like this quality of lawsuits that they surface interesting and valuable public information that would not have otherwise come to light. And so for that reason, and maybe that reason only, I am glad that Elon Musk brought this suit.\n\ncasey newton\n\nAnd speaking of that, Kevin, my understanding is that Mira Murati was recently deposed in the same lawsuit, which means that we should have another deposition to look forward to reading sometime soon.\n\nkevin roose\n\nI enjoy reading transcripts of depositions because at least like 30 percent of them are just lawyers arguing with each other about what their client does and doesn’t have to answer.\n\ncasey newton\n\nThis one has a lot of that.\n\nkevin roose\n\nA lot of that.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah.\n\nkevin roose\n\nVery juicy —\n\ncasey newton\n\n— not happy.\n\nkevin roose\n\nScreenwriters. A gift to screenwriters everywhere.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah, unfortunately, yeah, I think they finished filming that movie, but —\n\nkevin roose\n\nOh, OK. All right, stop generating.\n\ncasey newton\n\nAll right, this next story comes to us from Ashley Belanger at Ars Technica. “Meta Denies Torrenting Porn to Train AI, Saying The Downloads Were For Personal Use.”\n\nkevin roose\n\n[LAUGHS]:\n\ncasey newton\n\nI think I’ve heard that one before. Meta asked a US district court to toss a lawsuit alleging that the tech giant illegally torrented pornography to train AI, Kevin. The move comes after Strike 3 Holdings discovered illegal downloads of its adult films on Meta corporate IP addresses, as well as other downloads that Meta allegedly concealed using a stealth network of hidden IP addresses. Strike 3 brought a suit against Meta in July, seeking damages that have been estimated at more than $350 million. Now, we should say that Strike 3 has been accused of being something of a copyright troll. “The Guardian” actually just had a big story about that this week as well. At the same time, Kevin, one does have to wonder why was all that porn being downloaded at Metas headquarters?\n\nkevin roose\n\n[LAUGHS]: Right. So Meta’s defense here is that these were just employees who — or office guests or contractors who were just downloading these pornographic movies on the Meta network somehow. And Meta says that they are not training models on porn, and I believe them. But on the other hand, how do you think nasty Nancy got so nasty?\n\ncasey newton\n\nI’m glad you brought it up, because I think nasty Nancy, which is, of course, one of the very most popular chatbots on all of Meta’s properties, has some pretty steamy things to say, and she had to learn it somewhere. But look, obviously, people are criticizing Meta over this, but I just want to say, Do you think creating the Metaverse is easy? The people there — they need to blow off some steam. And sometimes that just means downloading porn on their work computers. So if you want to have a Metaverse, you’re going to just have to allow for some of this. And I know that you want the Metaverse.\n\nkevin roose\n\nOh, I do.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah.\n\nkevin roose\n\nI love that part of the Meta defense in this lawsuit, trying to get it thrown out, is that this was so little porn. Basically, they’re saying, look, if we were going to steal your copyrighted data to train our AI systems, we would steal a lot of it.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah, when you look at our previous copyright thefts, they’ve been hugely, hugely bigger by orders of magnitude.\n\nkevin roose\n\nOK, stop generating.\n\ncasey newton\n\nAll right.\n\nkevin roose\n\nCasey, this last one is near and dear to our hearts. This is a story that comes to us from my colleague Reggie Ugwu at “The New York Times,” and it is about podcasting and AI. It’s called “For Podcasters, a Voice Clone is a Double-Edged Sword.” Reggie explores how AI voice clones from places like ElevenLabs are starting to be used by some podcasters and asks the question, Are AI replicas a boon for productivity or a betrayal of the bond with listeners? Casey, what do you think of this?\n\ncasey newton\n\nWell, I think it depends. There are just certain cases where I think it might make sense to use a voice clone. I don’t think we’re going to be doing it on this show anytime soon. But look, right now I send out an email newsletter. It’s available only in text. Readers have been asking me for years to send out an audio version. Would they object to me doing it via voice clone? Some people have actually emailed me asking me to do just this, so I was glad to read Reggie’s story because this is something that’s been on my mind lately.\n\nkevin roose\n\nWhere do you think the line is for that? Would you be comfortable letting an AI voice clone read an ad in your voice?\n\ncasey newton\n\nI think that doesn’t feel good to me. I think that if you’re reading an ad, part of what the advertiser is buying is your personal contribution to it. Where I could see it on a podcast is very occasionally will make a mistake when recording the show, usually it’s Kevin, but then we’ll have to go back and fix it afterwards. Maybe I literally just had one or two of the wrong words. If you could use a voice clone to just quickly replace those words, I think that’s probably OK. You probably want to disclose that to people somewhere along the process. But in general, I think, as always, just disclose what you’re doing, and it’ll probably be fine.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah, I think this has potential, but less for replacing the voices of podcasters, but for allowing users to swap in their own preferred voices. Maybe you like some of what Casey says on this podcast, but you’d rather it be delivered in the silky baritone of an Ira Glass-type figure, and you can just swap in Ira’s voice.\n\ncasey newton\n\nIt’s true.\n\nkevin roose\n\nProblem solved.\n\ncasey newton\n\nActually, do you want to hear a funny story about this?\n\nkevin roose\n\nWhat?\n\ncasey newton\n\nSo I actually have been training a clone of my voice via ElevenLabs, just to see what it would be like to have it read my column. And I fed it a bunch of “Hard Fork” audio that our producer Whitney gave me for this purpose. And the problem is that my newsletter, I write in this typically somber tone throughout. And then in “Hard Fork,” I amp up my personality and sound like a crazy person. And it turns out that when you have a crazy person voice reading a somber column, I just sound insane. So I’m not actually able to use that voice clone.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYes, and if you want sad Casey in your AI voice pack, that’s going to cost you an extra $7 a month.\n\ncasey newton\n\nThat’s a premium feature.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAll right.\n\ncasey newton\n\nAll right, is there any more?\n\nkevin roose\n\nAnd we’re out of stories.\n\ncasey newton\n\nAnd we’re out of stories. That is HatGPT. Thanks for playing, everyone. [MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nkevin roose\n\nCasey, before we go, let’s make our AI disclosures.

    "text": "Four wrongful death lawsuits were filed against OpenAI on Thursday, as well as cases from three people who say the company’s chatbot led to mental health breakdowns.\n\nThe cases, filed in California state courts, claim that ChatGPT, which is used by 800 million people, is a flawed product. One suit calls it “defective and inherently dangerous.” A complaint filed by the father of Amaurie Lacey says the 17-year-old from Georgia chatted with the bot about suicide for a month before his death in August. Joshua Enneking, 26, from Florida, asked ChatGPT “what it would take for its reviewers to report his suicide plan to police,” according to a complaint filed by his mother. Zane Shamblin, a 23-year-old from Texas, died by suicide in July after encouragement from ChatGPT, according to the complaint filed by his family.\n\nJoe Ceccanti, a 48-year-old from Oregon, had used ChatGPT without problems for years, but he became convinced in April that it was sentient. His wife, Kate Fox, said in an interview in September that he had begun using ChatGPT compulsively and had acted erratically. He had a psychotic break in June, she said, and was hospitalized twice before dying by suicide in August.\n\n“The doctors don’t know how to deal with it,” Ms. Fox said.\n\nAn OpenAI spokeswoman said in a statement that the company was reviewing the filings, which were earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal and CNN. “This is an incredibly heartbreaking situation,” the statement said. “We train ChatGPT to recognize and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress, de-escalate conversations, and guide people toward real-world support. We continue to strengthen ChatGPT’s responses in sensitive moments, working closely with mental health clinicians.”",

But she was wary of traditional therapy after frustrating experiences in the past, so her husband suggested an alternative he had found online — a therapy chatbot, Ash, powered by artificial intelligence.\n\nMs. Bucicchia said it had taken a few days to get used to talking and texting with Ash, which responded to her questions and complaints, provided summaries of their conversations and suggested topics she could think about. But soon, she started leaning on it for emotional support, sharing the details of her daily life as well as her hopes and fears.\n\nAt one point, she said, she recounted a difficult memory about her time in a mental health facility. The chatbot replied that if she was having suicidal thoughts, she should contact a professional and gave her a toll-free number to call.",

To come up with tips, some were allowed to use a traditional Google search, while others could rely only on summaries of information generated automatically with Google’s artificial intelligence.\n\nThe people using A.I.-generated summaries wrote advice that was generic, obvious and largely unhelpful — eat healthy foods, stay hydrated and get lots of sleep! The people who found information with a traditional Google web search shared more nuanced advice about focusing on the various pillars of wellness, including physical, mental and emotional health.\n\nThe tech industry tells us that chatbots and new A.I. search tools will supercharge the way we learn and thrive, and that anyone who ignores the technology risks being left behind. But Dr. Melumad’s experiment, like other academic studies published so far on A.I.’s effects on the brain, found that people who rely heavily on chatbots and A.I. search tools for tasks like writing essays and research are generally performing worse than people who don’t use them.\n\n“I’m pretty frightened, to be frank,” Dr. Melumad said. “I’m worried about younger folks not knowing how to conduct a traditional Google search.”",

They are also cute, with pouting mouths and cubic bodies that come in a variety of bright, striking patterns: yellow with black polka dots, gray with blue stripes and more.\n\nTwo engineers at the University of Colorado Boulder are particularly intrigued with the spots, stripes and hexagons found on an Australian species in the boxfish family: the ornate boxfish. The designs on that species’ skin, they discovered, can be described and reproduced using decades-old mathematics once explored by Alan Turing, who is often referred to as the father of modern computing.\n\nThe engineers, Siamak Mirfendereski and Ankur Gupta, recently unveiled a mathematical model able to accurately recreate the ornate boxfish’s patterns, even accounting for the graininess and other imperfect features that are observed in nature.\n\nAccording to Dr. Gupta, the model, described in a study which was published last week in the journal Matter, brings scientists one step closer to understanding the mechanisms by which such patterns form in nature on fish and other organisms.",

One recent study looked at the 10 most valuable firms on the Nasdaq stock exchange between 2017 and 2022, a period that included the Covid-19 pandemic. It concluded that paying chief executives significantly more than the company president, other top executives or average employees did not increase a firm’s profitability.\n\nAnother study that looked at 429 large American firms over a decade found that total shareholder returns in companies where chief-executive pay was below the median for their sector did better than companies where pay exceeded it.\n\nHigh compensation can sometimes lead to overconfidence that results in bad decisions.

    "text": "A popular icebreaker involves asking which historical figures you’d like to have dinner with. Sora 2, the new video generator from OpenAI, suggests another option: Which historical figures would you like to see kill each other? The platform will produce short A.I. videos of almost anything users prompt it to — an ability that might, in some other world, unleash a flowering of human imagination. In ours, though, the typical Sora clip tends to feel like a mash-up of familiar sensationalist media, with influences including the crude conceits of old daytime talk shows, the improbable brain-rot formulas on YouTube — and, of course, fights.\n\nImagine Gandhi and Hitler, facing off in a wrestling ring. Picture Hitler tussling with Michael Jackson on an ersatz “Maury” set. Think of Stephen Hawking being chased by the police, or wiping out in a halfpipe, or executing a pile driver on a wrestling opponent — all rendered with the uncanny, rubbery whack of A.I. bodies colliding. Iconic moments such as the “I Have a Dream” speech are reframed in the style of hidden-camera prank shows or as baldly racist caricature. (OpenAI, facing some backlash, recently adjusted its laissez-faire policies to block the use of Martin Luther King Jr.’s likeness.) Thus far, the platform’s output has resembled the doodlings of a bored and somewhat sadistic middle schooler, killing time in the back of history class.\n\nThis is just one among many examples of what now feels like a trend in Silicon Valley. The tech industry is delivering on some of the futuristic notions of late-20th-century science fiction. Yet it seems, at times, bizarrely unaware that many of those notions were meant to be dystopian or satirical — dismal visions of where our worst and dumbest habits could lead us. You worry that someone in today’s tech world might watch “Gattaca” — a film that features a eugenicist future in which people with ordinary DNA are relegated to menial jobs — and see it as an inspirational launching point for a collaboration between 23andMe and a charter school.\n\nThe material on Sora, for instance, can feel oddly similar to the jokes about crass entertainment embedded in dystopian films and postmodern novels. In the movie “Idiocracy,” America loved a show called “Ow! My Balls!” in which a man is hit in the testicles in increasingly florid ways. “Robocop” imagined a show about a goggle-eyed pervert with an inane catchphrase. “The Running Man” had a game show in which contestants desperately collected dollar bills and climbed a rope to escape ravenous dogs. That Sora could be prompted to imagine a game show in which Michel Foucault chokeslams Ronald Reagan, or Prince battles an anaconda, doesn’t feel new; it feels like a gag from a 1990s writer or a film about social decay.",

Most of the apps have let users create free accounts with the option to pay for perks like unlimited swipes. But satisfaction with the apps has sunk, and so has the number of people willing to pay for them. (Most subscriptions cost around $30 a month.)\n\nOver the last year, Bumble lost 9 percent of its paid subscribers, while Match Group lost 5 percent, even as both grew their total number of users. While paying subscribers are a tiny slice of users, they generate a large portion of profits. The 20 percent of Match Group users that pay for features and subscriptions account for 97 percent of revenue.\n\nMatch Group’s shares have plunged 80 percent from their 2021 high, while Bumble’s stock is down 90 percent from its initial public offering that year. The two companies account for the majority of the dating app market.",

It argues the decision amounted to “intentional discrimination” and “bare animus,” inflicting deliberate hardship on states that voted against Mr. Trump in the last presidential election.",

    "text": "In one of his last letters to Berkshire Hathaway’s shareholders as the firm’s chief executive, Warren E. Buffett said Monday that he would speed up his plans to give away much of his $150 billion personal fortune to his children’s philanthropic foundations.\n\n\n\n“My children are now at their prime in respect to experience and wisdom but have yet to enter old age,” Mr. Buffett, 95, wrote of his daughter and two sons, who range in age from 67 to 72.\n\nMr. Buffett announced in May that he would step down at the end of this year and turn Berkshire Hathaway’s leadership over to Gregory Abel, 63, who joined Berkshire when it bought the energy business he led in 2000. Mr. Abel “understands many of our businesses and personnel far better than I now do,” Mr. Buffett wrote on Monday.\n\nMr. Abel will inherit a multinational conglomerate with a vast portfolio and a famously high stock price. Its “class A” shares ended trading on Friday at $748,320.\n\nFor 60 years, Mr. Buffett led Berkshire and transformed the company — named for a textile mill that his investment fund took over — into a venture whose holdings encapsulate the American economy. As he built the company into a $1 trillion juggernaut, Mr. Buffett became a household name, famed for his investing prowess and his folksy management approach.\n\n\n\nMr. Buffett’s annual letters to shareholders became part of his legend. The discursive notes mixed economic analysis, investment advice, leadership maxims and personal asides with updates on the health of the company’s railroads, energy businesses, retail shops and blue-chip stocks. (Mr. Abel has said he will continue the tradition and send his own annual dispatch.)",

And he claimed that the courts could “affect” the work to end the shutdown, despite the president’s continued absence from any talks.\n\nYet it remained unclear whether the Supreme Court would even need to rule on the government’s request. The Trump administration acknowledged the possibility in the very opening of its filing, which said the nascent deal in Congress “would end the shutdown and moot this application.”\n\nThe request arrived on a day when roughly two dozen states pressed ahead with their own legal campaign, which aimed to unlock long-frozen federal funds for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP. That case unfolded in a federal court in Massachusetts, where a judge on Monday temporarily blocked the Trump administration from carrying out a directive that would force states to “undo” some of the benefits they had already paid.\n\nBefore the hearing, several state officials said that the Trump administration’s decision to continue fighting — particularly as Congress had finally identified a way to fund the government — had been especially punitive, vindictive and harmful.\n\nLetitia James, the Democratic attorney general of New York, said in a news conference that states would use “every legal pathway to ensure families get the benefits they are entitled to.”",

(Amid the political pressures and the toll of the shutdown on Americans, a key bloc of Democrats joined Republicans in a vote on Sunday evening to advance legislation to reopen the government.)",

But the Trump administration held firm in its refusal to fund food stamps in full, telling a court in a strongly worded filing that states would be “responsible for the consequences” of their actions.\n\nThen, in a late-night order, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit denied the Trump administration’s request to put on hold a district court order to fund SNAP in full for November.",

The cuts were concentrated among flights offered by three of the largest carriers, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines, which dominate many of those busy airports.\n\nAmerican canceled about 740 flights on Friday and Saturday, or more than 6.5 percent of its schedule for those days, according to Cirium, an aviation data firm. Delta canceled about 640 flights across both days, or over 7.3 percent of its schedule, while United cut over 450 flights or more than 5.2 percent of its schedule.\n\nBut the disruption was worse on Sunday. More than 2,000 flights had been canceled by midafternoon, making it the year’s fourth worst day for cancellations, behind a handful of days in January when storms disrupted flying, according to Cirium. Delta had canceled more than 14 percent of its schedule by midafternoon on Sunday, while American and United had each canceled more than 9 percent.",

Or is it a tone-deaf overreach with an unabashed “L’état, c’est moi” vibe?\n\nQuestions like these have coursed through nearly a quarter-millennium of American coinage history, as the country has sought to stamp reflections of its ideals on flat, round pieces of metal.\n\nEmperors, kings and rulers had appeared on coins for some 2,000 years by the late 18th century, when the daring democratic experiment known as the United States came into being. Its founding fathers worked to create a constitutional republic after having just extricated the colonies from England, where coins depicting the double-chinned bust of King George III jingled a constant reminder of who lorded over whom.\n\nHeeding the first president’s aversion to anything hinting of monarchy, Congress passed the Coinage Act of 1792, which stipulated that American coins bear an allegorical depiction of freedom, along with the inscription “Liberty.” It did not specifically forbid the use of a president’s likeness, but the implication was: No image of any leader, past or present.",

    "text": "Looking for a juiced-up Bluetooth speaker that can also keep your other devices charged? The JBL Charge 6 is currently marked down to just $130 on Amazon, an impressive $70 off its usual list price.\n\nLike other JBL Bluetooth speakers, the Charge 6 has a big, loud sound profile. It's great for parties thanks to its bass-forward setup, and it gets loud enough for a dance party or quiet enough for an evening by the campfire. It also packs in the features we'd expect from a modern portable speaker, like Auracast, which will let you pair it with other compatible JBL speakers to form a network of sound. You can even plug it into some devices for lossless playback, if you're craving a little more detail and nuance in your sound.\n\nWhile the Charge 6 is a decent Bluetooth speaker in its own right, it also acts as a charging hub for your other devices, saving you from having to carry around two separate chunks of plastic. The USB-C port on the side can charge your phone, and it has enough juice for up to 24 hours of listening, or up to 28 hours with Playtime Boost, a JBL feature that squeezes some extra life out of a Bluetooth speaker's battery.\n\nIt's available in a variety of fun and exciting colors, so you don't have to settle for just plain black or white. I spotted the same $70 discount on every in-stock color, including the vaguely hot dog-looking Pink option, and the camo-like Squad color, in case you need your speakers to hide in the woods with you. It also includes a carrying strap, and while our reviewer Ryan Waniata wasn't enthused by the strap's durability, it may help you lug around the comparatively heavy 3-pound speaker. It's at least quite rugged, with an IP68 dust and water rating, one of the strongest available.\n\nThe biggest downside to the Charge 6 is its relatively high price point, so taking almost half off the purchase price makes this a much more appealing buy. If it’s a bit too big for your lifestyle, make sure to swing by our roundup of Bluetooth speakers for all of our favorite picks.",

    "text": "Tech companies have invested so much money in building data centers in recent months, it’s actively driving the US economy—and the AI race is showing no signs of slowing down. Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg told President Donald Trump last week that the company would spend $600 billion on US infrastructure—including data centers—by 2028, while OpenAI has committed already to spending $1.4 trillion.\n\nAn extensive new analysis looks at the environmental footprint of data centers in the US to get a handle on what, exactly, the country might be facing as this buildout continues over the next few years—and where the US should be building data centers to avoid the most harmful environmental impacts.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Nature Communications on Monday, uses a variety of data, including demand for AI chips and information on state electricity and water scarcity, to project the potential environmental impacts of future data centers through the end of the decade. The study models a number of different possible scenarios on how data centers could affect the US and the planet—and cautions that tech companies’ net zero promises aren’t likely to hold up against the energy and water needs of the massive facilities they’re building.\n\nFengqi You, a professor in energy systems engineering at Cornell and one of the authors of the analysis, says that the study, which began three years ago, comes at “a perfect time to understand how AI is making an impact on climate systems and water usage and consumption.”\n\nThe AI industry “is growing much faster than we expected,” he adds—especially with the Trump administration’s laser focus on the industry. “This whole thing is just getting so much momentum right now.”\n\nNot all data centers are created environmentally equal: a lot of their water and carbon footprint depends on where they’re located. Some US states may have grids that run more on renewable energy, or are making big strides in putting more clean energy on the grid; this greatly lessens the carbon emissions from data centers that draw power from those grids. Similarly, states with less water scarcity are better suited to provide the large amounts of water needed for cooling data centers. (Cooling also constitutes a big part of data center energy use.) The best locations for a data center over the next few years in the US are states that strike a balance between these two inputs: Texas, Montana, Nebraska, and South Dakota, the analysis finds, are “optimal candidates for AI server installations.”\n\nMuch of the data center buildout in the US has historically focused on places like Virginia, the data center hub of the US, and Northern California. Being close to Washington, DC, and Silicon Valley was important to data center companies, as were the dense fiber connectivity in those regions and their skilled workforces. Virginia has also offered substantial tax breaks for data centers for years—one technique other states are turning to to lure development. According to Data Center Map, an industry tool that tracks data center development, of the 4,000-plus data centers in the US, more than 650 are in Virginia—the most in the country—and California has more than 320, ranking third.",

    "text": "WITH THE END of the US government shutdown in sight, disorganization still reigns at federal agencies. Workers at the Environmental Protection Agency tell WIRED that they have faced increasing chaos over the past five weeks.\n\nIn recent weeks, varied phases of furloughs have forced staff to go home in seemingly random waves. Some employees remaining at the agency are working on policies friendly to fossil fuel and industrial interests that are a priority of the administration, even as the rest of the government shuts down.\n\nOthers have had to sit on their hands, as the shutdown takes out colleagues with no notice—and remaining employees have little to no information as to what is coming next.\n\n“We learn who is furloughed when we send an email to someone and get the out-of-office message, or we hover over names in Teams for people who are showing out of office,” one EPA worker tells WIRED. (This worker, and others in this story, were granted anonymity because they aren’t permitted to speak to the press.)\n\nSome employees who are being kept are at work revising pollution rules, a core deregulatory goal of the administration. An employee at the Office of Air and Radiation confirmed to WIRED that their team, which is working on rule revisions in that office, is still being called in to work, while others in the office—including support staff like administrative assistants and operations workers—were sent home the week of October 20.\n\n“Staff working in the regulatory part of the air office are still working,” the employee tells WIRED. “Lots of furloughs elsewhere. But we’re still working on deregulatory actions.” The New York Times reported in mid-October that other staffers working to repeal rules friendly to oil, gas, and coal interests were also being told to “press on.”\n\nAround 4,400 employees, WIRED has learned, had been furloughed at the agency as of late October. According to the EPA’s shutdown plan, which was last updated in September, the agency employed more than 15,000 people as of October 1. In the plan, the agency lists just 1,734 employees expected to be retained in the event of a full shutdown. These employees would work on “significant agency activities” deemed crucial enough to be continued in a lapse, including Superfund activities, disaster assistance, criminal investigations, and the preservation of research.\n\nFollowing a Sunday vote in the Senate, the government shutdown could end as early as this week.\n\nOMB director Russell Vought, the public face of the government shutdown, has tried to use it as a way to further cut back the size of the federal workforce. But more than a month into the shutdown, workers at the EPA have mostly escaped the high-profile reductions in force and mass furloughs that have hit other agencies. Many workers are still coming in to do their jobs as the agency tries to continue business as usual. EPA administrator Lee Zeldin, meanwhile, has squarely blamed Democrats.",

    "text": "More evidence has emerged to support the natural origin of comet 3I/Atlas. After several weeks of conspiracy theories, social media debates, and speculation on popular podcasts such as Joe Rogan's, this interstellar object is still a comet. The most recent confirmation came from an observatory in South Africa that detected the first radio signal from 3I/Atlas.\n\nBut how? A radio signal? That would have to confirm the object is technlogical in nature, wouldn't it? The thing is, this isn't a radio signal like a transmission emitted by a spacecraft. It's instead a radio frequency pattern detected by MeerKAT, a radio telescope composed of 64 antennas—each with a diameter of 13.5 meters—operated by the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory. And what did it detect? \"OH absorption was detected on the 1665 MHz and 1667 MHz lines,\" according to the researchers.\n\nWhat MeerKAT specifically detected were lines of radio absorption by hydroxyl radicals, that is, OH molecules, a pattern that would be consistent with typical comet activity. The lines appear as absorption because 3I/Atlas was very close to the sun and the observing geometry favors absorption over emission. This is the phenomenon explained in WIRED a few days ago when the controversy about non-gravitational acceleration arose: When comets reach their closest point to the sun, they sublimate ice into space and receive a greater amount of radiation. This also causes them to alter their trajectory.\n\nThe hydroxyl radical (OH) can absorb or emit radiation at specific frequencies (such as the 1665 and 1667 MHz lines) due to transitions in its energy levels. These OH spectral lines have been detected in nebulae, comets, and star-forming regions. OH helps astronomers map the star- and water-born regions of the universe because it can \"glow\" brightly at radio frequencies under certain conditions.\n\nIs There Still Hope That It's More Than a Comet?\n\nThe detection was possible on October 24, five days before 3I/Atlas reached its closest point to the sun. MeerKAT attempted to detect radio signals earlier, on September 20 and 28, although it was unsuccessful. “Five weeks ago, I encouraged radio observatories like MeerKAT to search for radio emission from 3I/ATLAS given that the arrival direction of 3I/ATLAS coincided to within 9 degrees with the arrival direction of the Wow! Signal detected in 1977 at a frequency of 1.4204556 gigahertz,” astrophysicist Avi Loeb wrote in a Medium post. “In response, I was assured that 3I/ATLAS will be monitored by radio observatories like MeerKAT.”\n\nLoeb acknowledged that \"no radio detection of 3I/ATLAS has been reported so far, other than the OH absorption signal.\" Of course, continued monitoring of the object would need to be conducted to determine whether the OH production is constant or intermittent, along with factors such as the extent and structure of the tail, to reach more solid conclusions about its nature.\n\nLoeb has been has been among the most vocal advocates of the hypothesis that 3I/Atlas has a technological origin. (And he has already invited Kim Kardashian to join his research team.) The MeerKAT findings have not dampened his drive to probe the comet's nature. \"On March 16, 2026, 3I/ATLAS is expected to pass within 53 million kilometers from Jupiter. At that time, the Juno spacecraft will use its dipole antenna to search for a radio signal from 3I/ATLAS at low frequencies ranging from 50 hertz to 40 megahertz,\" he wrote.\n\nWill the MeerKAT detection be enough to put an end to conspiracy theories about 3I/Atlas? Likely not, and at least the debates have heightened the general public's awareness of and interest in astrophysics. In the meantime, you can view the trajectory of comet 3I/Atlas here. And don't forget to mark December 19 on the calendar—that's when the interstellar guest will reach its closest point to Earth.\n\nThis story first appeared on WIRED en Español and has been translated from Spanish.",

All told, it sets a high mark for performance.

The unit does get a little warm and a little loud under load; the heat is manageable, but the sound can be a bit much.\n\nThe laptop doesn’t just perform well, it also looks great doing it. Matte black inside and out, with a “stealth hinge” that disappears into the rear of the machine, the device looks modern and understated, with little more than a tiny Asus logo on a corner of the lid by way of flair. The paint is quite smudge-resistant as well. When opened, the unit reveals a thoughtfully designed keyboard with excellent backlighting—though I would have preferred full-height arrow keys instead of the half-height ones here. A numeric keypad would also have been nice, but that would certainly have cramped the design a bit.\n\nDialed In\n\nPhotograph: Chris Null\n\nThe touchpad deserves its own discussion. While the spacious tracking area is responsive (if perhaps overly large), it’s the small dial embedded in the pad in the upper-left that immediately draws the eye. This is a feature called Asus DialPad, and it’s a special part of the touchpad that can be used to perform context-sensitive functions within apps that support it (largely photo and video editing apps) by dialing in a circle.",

    "text": "In the history of gluteal enhancement, Mexico City stands out. It protrudes. It was here, in 1979, that a plastic surgeon, Mario González-Ulloa, first installed a pair of silicone implants designed specifically for the buttocks. The textbook Body Sculpting with Silicone Implants calls González-Ulloa the “grandfather of buttock augmentation.” The early 2000s saw a new generation of Mexico City buttock transformation luminaries, notably Ramón Cuenca-Guerra. In his 2004 paper “What Makes Buttocks Beautiful?” Cuenca-Guerra laid out four characteristics that “determine attractive buttocks” as well as the five types of “defects,” with strategies for correcting each one. I, for instance, have defect type 5, the “senile buttock.” (González-Ulloa’s depiction of this took the form of charcoal nudes contrasting “the typical ‘happy buttock’”—high, rounded, dimpled—with its counterpart, the low-slung, drooping “sad buttock.”)\n\nCourtesy of W.W. Norton Buy This Book At: Amazon\n\nBookshop.org\n\nBooks-A-Million If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more.\n\nWhile I understand the value of standardizing procedures and setting guidelines for surgical practice, I tripped over Cuenca-Guerra’s methodology. How and by whom had the determinants been determined? Like this: 1,320 photographs of “nude women ages 20 to 35 years, as seen from behind” were presented to a panel of six plastic surgeons, who “pointed out which buttocks they considered attractive and harmonious, and features on which this attractiveness depended.” Oho!\n\nI thought it would be interesting to talk to Cuenca-Guerra about the notion of a visually ideal female figure. As something that could or should be surgically created (or, in the case of the senile buttock, re-created). As something that even exists. I sent an email using the address on a more recent journal paper. There was no reply. Ramón Cuenca-Guerra’s buttocks are in worse shape than mine. He has been dead for some time. I was able to reach a colleague of his, José Luis Daza-Flores. Here was the third generation; just as Cuenca-Guerra had studied under González-Ulloa, Daza-Flores had studied under Cuenca-Guerra, extending the lineage and making Daza-Flores, I guess, “the son of buttock augmentation.”\n\nDaza-Flores collaborated with Cuenca-Guerra on a paper called “Calf Implants,” in which the team did for the lower leg what Cuenca-Guerra had done for the butt: laid out “the anatomical characteristics that make calves look attractive” and the “defects” to be addressed. Here again, plastic surgeons were recruited to judge images—2,600 of them, a vast photographic millipede of female legs.\n\nThe paper took an unexpected turn. Referring to a marked-up photograph of a lower leg deemed attractive, the authors tried to show that its measurements conformed to what is known in mathematics as the divine proportion (or golden ratio)—1.6 (I’m rounding it off) to 1. When you divide a line into two parts such that the whole length divided by the long part is equal to the long part divided by the short part, both those ratios will be 1.6 to 1. I found an illustration of the divine proportion on a website called Math Is Fun (and convincing no one). The golden dividing line splits the length such that one chunk is roughly two-thirds and the other is around one-third. The ancient Greeks divided the “ideal” face into similarly proportioned thirds. This was the first time I’d seen the divine proportion applied to a leg.\n\nThe paper contained sentences like this: “Seventeen women had thin legs, in the shape of a tube, and a mere 1:1.618 ratio in the A-P and L-L projections.” Though I confess to not grasping the particulars of the discussion, I believe that to be a mathematically precise description of cankles.",

    "text": "Alex Karp and I would not seem to have much in common. I work for WIRED, which does tough reporting on Trumpworld; Karp is the CEO of Palantir, a $450 billion firm that has contracts with agencies like the CIA and ICE and worked for the Israeli military during its campaign in Gaza. I live in the East Village of New York City, and the home Karp spends the most time in is a 500-acre compound in rural New Hampshire. (Last year he was one of the highest paid executives in the United States.) I was a plain old English major, and he’s got a law degree and a PhD in philosophy, studying under the legendary Jürgen Habermas. I consider myself a progressive; Karp regards that stuff as “pagan religion.”\n\nBut we can bond over one shared status: Both of us are alumni of Central High School, a Philadelphia magnet school. (Not at the same time. I have some years on the 58-year-old executive.) Maybe it was that connection that led Karp to agree to a sit-down. The son of a Jewish pediatrician and a Black artist, Karp struggled with dyslexia, and at Central he seems to have turned a corner—even speculating now that overcoming the challenge helped position him for later success.\n\nWe conducted our interview at an annual gathering of Palantir’s corporate customers. The event had the giddy vibe of a multilevel marketing summit. The customers I talked to—from giants like American Airlines to relatively modest family firms—said that Palantir’s AI-powered systems are expensive but well worth it.\n\nThe Big Interview Read more deep, weird, smart conversations with the most important people in our world.\n\nNot presenting at the event are the customers who provide Palantir with the majority of its business—the US government and its allies. (The company does not do business with Russia or China.) Palantir was founded to put Silicon Valley’s innovation into defense and government technology. With coauthor Nicholas Zamiska (a Palantirian), Karp laid out his philosophy earlier this year in a book called The Technological Republic, a surprisingly readable polemic that skewers Silicon Valley for insufficient patriotism. In Karp’s view, the antiestablishment tone of Apple’s Macintosh marketing was the original sin in a tech culture that celebrates indulgent individualism and neglects nationalist concerns. At the conference, Karp, dressed in a white T-shirt and jeans, began his opening remarks by saying, “We’ve been at odds with Silicon Valley on and off since our inception 20 years ago.” In 2020, Karp moved the company headquarters from Palo Alto to Denver, whereupon it became that state’s wealthiest corporation.\n\nSome see Karp as a dystopic supervillain. He responds to those critics aggressively, bluntly, and without a shred of remorse. After years of contracts, the company has apparently proven to the government’s satisfaction that its tools can effectively leverage information on the battlefield and in intelligence operations. Palantir has a multimillion-dollar contract with ICE involving “targeting and enforcement”—essentially helping the agency to locate people for deportation. In Ukraine, Karp says with pride, the company’s products have helped deliver lethal force. Palantir has a Code of Conduct that supposedly binds the company to, among other things, “protect privacy and civil liberties,” “protect the vulnerable,” “respect human dignity,” and “preserve and promote democracy.” In an open letter last May, 13 former workers accused Palantir’s leadership of having abandoned its founding values and of being complicit in “normalizing authoritarianism under the guise of a ‘revolution’ led by oligarchs.” Karp has also revealed that other employees have left because of the company’s work with the Israel military. His retort: If you’re not generating opposition, you’re probably doing something wrong.\n\nBeneath his fiery defense of Palantir, I sense that Karp yearns to be understood. He noted that all anyone wants to talk to him about is ICE, Israel, and Ukraine. I wanted to visit those subjects, too, and we did. But our conversation also touched on Donald Trump, democracy, and his love affair with German culture. Oh, and Central High.",

    "text": "“It’s time for your lice check,” a woman who goes by “Ms. K” whispers directly into my ear as she starts running her fingers into my scalp and through each strand of hair. I’m in a dark room, Eastern flute music playing in the background as I sit across from my partner who’s also having his hair caressed by a stranger. We close our eyes so we don’t burst out laughing.\n\n“OK kiddos, nobody wants to start their first day of school,” coos “Ms. A,” my partner’s lice checker, in a soft, velvety voice, most likely noticing the dumbfounded looks on our faces. “We’re going to be really thorough, because a lot of critters and cooties can hide pretty well.”\n\nYou might be wondering, am I a child? The answer is no.\n\nOur inspectors move on to drawing lines and circles into our heads with metal sticks before brushing our hair with combs as tingly, shivery sensations crawl from the back of my ears down to the middle of my spine. At first it’s uncomfortable, because honestly, I’ve never felt this sensation before and I’m not sure I’m doing whatever I should be right. But after 10 minutes of leaning into the uncertainty and nearly falling asleep, our session ends as we’re both “cleared” of lice and they tell us to “get back to class.”\n\nYou might be wondering, am I a child? The answer is no. This also isn’t some kind of kink. I’m in my thirties, and I have not-so-fond memories of lining up for lice checks back in the early 2000s in elementary school. But I’m here to experience at Tinglesbar ASMR Spa & Collective in Toronto, Canada. Dubbed the world’s first dedicated ASMR spa, I’m with a group of strangers pretending to be fifth grade students for a role-paying ASMR experience—and yes, I’m completely terrified.\n\nAs a cynical person who hates viral internet trends transplanted to IRL scenarios (think Labubu milkshakes on sale at Erewhon), I thought I’d never be able to take this seriously, especially when it came to strangers touching me or whispering in my ear. ASMR, or autonomous sensory meridian response, is a sensation triggered by sounds, touch, feel, that send a tingly sensation through the body, usually around the neck and spine area. Its loyalists claim that it triggers a sense of total relaxation and calmness, eases anxiety, and even helps with insomnia. The term was technically coined in 2010, and since then, ASMR videos have skyrocketed on YouTube and TikTok, garnering billions of views. Some of the genre’s content creators have made ASMR a full-time job, and year after year it remains one of the most searched terms on the platforms.\n\nIn the past couple of years, spas and wellness retreats offering ASMR experiences have popped up in the US, UK, and Canada, offering back scratching, hair and face brushing, and soundscapes. But Tinglesbar stands out for its role-playing offerings, which include Harry Potter role-play that aims to “un-petrify” you, a Fairy’s Fortune role-play “offering sweet fairy whimsy and gentle answers from your mystical guide,” a doctor’s visit that “blends light tapping, gentle examinations, and reassuring conversation to melt away tension,” and a 1940s beauty salon experience, in addition to the group hangouts. The particulars can be customized, depending on one's “ASMR triggers.” Prices range from CAD$139 for a solo session with $50 add-ons for role-playing, or $25 to $75 for group hangs.",

    "text": "In the opening scenes of the Amazon Prime series House of David season 2, shortly after the titular David slays Goliath with a stone to the forehead, battle rages around the biblical figure.\n\nA dusty visual overlay partially obscures crowds of men in the desert, sword-fighting in armor and on horseback. With some wardrobe tweaks, this scene could look like something out of Game of Thrones or Dune. But House of David showrunner Jon Erwin says he didn’t have the budget to bring these scenes to life. Instead, he used AI.\n\n“The entire shot is done using these tools, virtually,” Erwin tells WIRED. “And the cost of augmenting those shots is minuscule compared to the time and cost it would have been to generate those with, you know, traditional VFX methods.”\n\nErwin’s faith-based production company the Wonder Project sent WIRED nearly two dozen still images from “mostly AI-generated scenes” from House of David season 2, which the company says used more than four times as many AI shots compared to the show’s first season—from more than 70 in season 1 to between 350 and 400 shots for season 2. The show’s second season follows the eventual King David of Israel in the year 1000 BCE.\n\nMany of the images were of crowds during battle sequences, but AI was also used for shots of stone fortresses, fires ravaging hillsides, and heroes standing at the tops of mountains, staring out over foggy landscapes. They don’t bear the wonky hallmarks of generative AI output from years past, but it’s not hard to believe they were AI-generated.\n\n“Let’s say we only have the money to have a certain scale to the frame,” Erwin says. “You can put a very real camera on a very real actor and direct that actor, direct the camera, and that becomes, in essence, the hand inside a puppet. The puppet itself is this digital world that you create.”\n\nThe way Erwin talks about “magical” AI filmmaking is very different from how most people in Hollywood and its audience have. Oscar-winning Frankenstein director Guillermo del Toro recently told WIRED he hopes he dies before AI art goes mainstream, comparing the “arrogance” of tech bros to Victor Frankenstein himself. Wicked star Ariana Grande liked an Instagram post that indicated she’d prefer to never see an AI-generated image ever again. And Coca-Cola just steeled itself for another round of consumer backlash to its second annual AI-generated holiday ad, which it received in the form of viral reactions like, “Biggest company in the world proudly admitting to accelerating the apocalypse and asking ‘what are you going to do about it?’”\n\nBut Coca-Cola execs and AI enthusiasts like Erwin say that the loudest people complaining are more like a shrinking minority (the founder of the AI company that made the Coke ad actually told the Hollywood Reporter the “haters” were mainly creatives “afraid for their jobs” versus “average people”), while AI companies like Runway have signed deals with studios like Lionsgate to train custom AI tools on its archives. Erwin said he’s used Runway’s “image to video” tools, as well as Luma’s “modification” features and products from Google and Adobe.",

    "text": "Others Tested\n\nPhotograph: Molly Higgins\n\nAurelia Lingerie Subscription Box Starting at $85 (Monthly): A monthly lingerie subscription box is sure to keep things spicy. This small, Canadian-based lingerie retailer has human-curated lingerie subscription boxes and size-inclusive lingerie (they carry bra sizes A-M and panties XS-4XL). When beginning the lingerie subscription service, you fill out a style quiz that asks you a series of questions about style preferences and a human stylist creates a unique box for you or your lover. The box also comes with a guide on how to measure your cup size, with troubleshooting tips, a measuring tape, and a zippered net case for washing the delicates.\n\nUnderclub Subscription Box Starting at $85 (Underwear): With Underclub, you can give both a practical and sexy gift to your lover every month. Subscribers can choose between a bralette set with a matching top and bottom or two pairs of underwear bottoms delivered each month. When you sign up, you’ll be asked a series of questions about your personal preferences and a stylist will curate an underwear box for you. The bra sizes range from XS to 2XL, 30 to 42 inches in band size, and A-DD.\n\nMagic Wand Mini for $76: This lil guy is iconic for a reason. The handheld vibrating wand provides powerful stimulation over a large surface area. It gets around three hours of battery life, not that your giftee will be using it for that long in one go (maybe!). The Mini is easier to hold and use compared to the original, larger Magic Wand, and its buttons are convenient to reach. —Eric Ravenscraft\n\nLelo Sona 2 Cruise for $114: We once called this “the Cadillac of suction toys” in our Best Clitoral Suction Toys guide. It's small and discreet, and can be as gentle or as intense as you like. It has an elegant, curvy body with chrome accents that make it stylish enough to look good on your nightstand. The “Cruise” part of the name refers to Lelo's Cruise Control technology, which makes the toy ramp up intensity when you press it hard against your body. —Eric Ravenscraft\n\nLovense Gravity for $144: Vibrators can provide a lot of fulfilling stimulation, but one thing most of them lack is thrust. This vibrator from Lovense straddles the line between vibrator and sex machine (which is why it earns a spot in our Best Sex Machines guide), with a motor for automated thrust as well as vibration. It comes with a suction-cup mount, and it can also be controlled through the company’s robust mobile app for easier remote control or to customize thrust and vibration patterns. —Eric Ravenscraft\n\nDame Pom Flexible Vibrator for $95: A mainstay in our Best Vibrators guide, the Dame Pom Flexible Vibrator is a little powerful handheld vibe that's also gorgeous and intuitively designed. It has the power you’d expect from a bullet vibe, but the added silicone body diffuses the vibrations through a broad area for a unique experience. Not only is it easy to hold and operate one-handed, but it also fits neatly in the palm of most hands. All the buttons are right where your fingers land naturally. —Eric Ravenscraft\n\nMysteryVibe Crescendo 2 for $230: This flexible, bendable vibrator has six separate motors, all of which can be customized and controlled from its included app. But what sets it apart is its semi-rigid jointed body. You can straighten it out to use for more direct penetration, or curl it up, similar to how one might bend their fingers. It won't lock into position so some resistance can bend it right back, but it's handy for hitting some of those more hard-to-reach spots on and in your body. —Eric Ravenscraft\n\nLelo Personal Moisturizer Water-Based Lube for $12: This water-based lube tops our Best Lubes guide. It's a bit pricier per ounce than others, but it's worth it. Many lubes get sticky or thick pretty quickly, but Lelo's manages to stay fluid and smooth throughout playtime. It's also paraben- and glycerine-free, which is great for people with skin sensitivities. —Eric Ravenscraft\n\nLelo Hex Condoms for $23: We've tested a bunch of condoms, and the Lelo Hex was our top pick. The same company that makes some of our favorite sex toys also makes very sturdy condoms. They have a stylish hexagonal pattern that Lelo claims makes the condoms sturdier, and they didn't break as easily as others in our tests. It's also one of the most comfortable condoms I've worn, with the hexagon pattern helping to add a bit of grip to prevent slippage. —Eric Ravenscraft\n\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

    "text": "Apple has removed two of the most popular gay dating apps in China from the App Store after receiving an order from China’s main internet regulator and censorship authority, WIRED has learned. The move comes as reports of Blued and Finka disappearing from the iOS App Store and several Android app stores circulated on Chinese social media over the weekend. The apps appear to still be functional for users in the country who already have them downloaded.\n\n“We follow the laws in the countries where we operate. Based on an order from the Cyberspace Administration of China, we have removed these two apps from the China storefront only,” an Apple spokesperson said in an email. Apple clarified that the apps have not been available in other countries for some time. “Earlier this year, the developer of Finka elected to remove the app from storefronts outside of China, and Blued was available only in China.”\n\nMost international LGBTQ+ dating apps are already blocked in China. Grindr was removed from Apple’s Chinese App Store in 2022.\n\nChina decriminalized homosexuality in the 1990s, but the government does not recognize same-sex marriage. In recent years, China’s LGBTQ+ community has increasingly come under pressure as the Chinese Communist Party tightens its control over civil society and free expression. Several prominent gay rights organizations in China have shut down, and social media companies now frequently censor LGBTQ+ content and accounts.\n\nThe Chinese embassy in Washington, DC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn July, Blued abruptly stopped new user registration without giving an explanation, according to Chinese social media posts. For a month, Chinese users who wanted to get on the platform were paying as much as $20 for secondhand Blued accounts on ecommerce websites. But registration resumed in mid-August.\n\nIn 2020, BlueCity, the parent company of Blued, went public. It announced that the app had over 49 million registered users and over 6 million monthly active users. The same year, BlueCity said it was acquiring Finka, its main competitor in China, for about $33 million. The company delisted in 2022 and was acquired by Newborn Town, a Hong Kong–listed social media firm. Most of the longtime employees of Blued, including its founder Ma Baoli, left the company after the acquisition, says a former Blued employee who asked not to be named for privacy reasons.",

    "summary": "Compare the Top 8 Pizza Ovens Tips and FAQ",
    "text": "Compare the Top 8 Pizza Ovens\n\nTips and FAQ\n\nHonorable Mentions\n\nWe've tried a lot of pizza ovens. Here are a few that we liked that didn't quite make our top picks.\n\nPhotograph: Stove Pi Prime\n\nSolo Stove Pi Prime for $450: The Solo Stove Pi Prime remains a very, very tight contender for our top gas oven pick. If you've heard of Solo Stove, it's because of its smokeless, stainless steel fire pits. This made the company's transition to high-heat pizza ovens more or less seamless. Instead of the conventional elongated design, the Pi Prime oven's fuel attachments are long and slim and hug the back of the oven. This allows Solo Stove to keep its signature round, symmetrical design. This really is a great design, and this remarkably compact propane pizza oven has previously been among WIRED's top picks. The cooking surface is large enough to accommodate a large Lodge cast-iron pan. If you have a small backyard, the top's flat surface is a convenient storage space, and the stove doesn't sacrifice any of its heating capabilities for these details. So why is the Koda 2 better than Solo Stove Pi Prime in our books? The Koda 2 allows for bigger 14-inch pies, and the broader opening makes launching a bit easier. (But note, if you live in a windy area, the Pi Prime offers better wind shielding than the Koda.)\n\nPhotograph: Matthew Korfhage\n\nHalo Versa 16 for $499: At first blush, the Halo Versa 16 appears to offer much the same specs as the All-Clad gas-powered pizza oven, but for half the price. It's got a rotating pizza stone, room for a 16-inch pie, and a clever extra feature: a little heater under the pizza stone. This said, the built-in thermometer isn't accurate (at all!), and insulation isn't the best, leading to a hot exterior. The oven doesn't reach its advertised top temps of 950 degrees Fahrenheit, though it can generally heat the stone to about 800 degrees. Consider this a better oven for New York–style pies, at a quite affordable price when you take into account the rotating stone.\n\nGozney\n\nGozney Roccbox for $499: When Adrienne So first reviewed the dual-fuel Gozney Roccbox, she praised the fast recovery time that has made the Roccbox popular among pizza pop-up chefs, allowing her to make 10 pies in less than 30 minutes when cooking pizza with propane. That said, few home pizza makers need such throughput, and the 44-pound device is heavier than other competitors. The optional woodbox was oppressively difficult to use, for those who want the ability to cook with fire. But the Gozney's price, previously among the most expensive entrants, now seems downright reasonable. And Matthew Korfhage's experience using the default propane option has been good, with terrific temperature stability.\n\nOoni Karu, First Edition for $349: Ooni is still selling the previous generation oven of WIRED's top pick, the Karu 2, for about $100 less. Like other Ooni pizza ovens, OG Karu is an excellent oven—light, portable, and easy to clean—and WIRED reviewer Adrienne So couldn't stop using the thing after first testing it. Nonetheless the newer Karu 2 heats more evenly, and holds more fuel than the first-generation oven.\n\nOoni Koda 12 for $399: The original Ooni Koda 12 is a mere 21 pounds, making it the most light and portable Koda. Its thin, powder-coated steel shell insulates well enough that it remains cool to the touch, even when the fire is burning. Just slide in the baking stone, screw on the propane tank, and you're ready to go. The door fits 12-inch pizza peels and 10-inch cast-iron skillets. However, you should not store it outside.\n\nPhotograph: Breville\n\nBreville Pizzaiolo for $800: The Breville Pizzaiolo was our prior top-pick electric pizza oven, and like a lot of Breville devices it offers beauteous ease of use and admirable technological sophistication, with three separate heating elements and two sensors that make sure each part of your pie is perfectly cooked. Where the first-generation Ooni Volt edged it out was with better insulation, a higher max temperature, and more versatility for cooking other things besides pizza. Note, however, that the Volt will soon be fully phased out for the second-generation Volt 2, which follows Breville's lead in moving toward greater automation.\n\nCuisinart 3-in-1 Propel Pizza Oven and Grill for $600: This Cuisinart Propel 3-in-1 offers an ingenious design. It's a four-burner stand-up grill and griddle that's perfectly good for burgers or pancakes—but with a pizza stone and mount, and a domed pizza lid. A smoked-glass door and temperature gauge lets you monitor your pie and turn your pizza without losing all the heat, while the side griddle means you can even cook toppings or sauces on the same device, without having to wander inside and outside. The extra workspace offered by the side tables is likewise truly welcome. But there are trade-offs to this versatility. You can heat your stone above 900 degrees Fahrenheit without trouble, but you won't get reliable ambient baking temps above 750. And so there's a bit of a learning curve. You'll want to turn your middle burners down but leave the side burners on, to cook something between a New York pie and a Neapolitan. The build's also a little clattery, and the poorly made burner knobs have an irritating habit of slipping on their pegs. This last flaw knocked this oven down to our honorable mentions, despite the Propel's cleverness and versatility.\n\nPhotograph: Adrienne So\n\nNinja Wood-Fired Oven for $300: If you're looking for a remarkably sturdy and versatile outdoor oven, this is a pretty good pick with a top temperature of 700 degrees Fahrenheit. The door is a little sticky, which makes baking pizza at high heat a little tricky, but if you want one device that can do everything from smoking a pork shoulder to making muffins to bake a pizza pie, this is your pick.\n\nThe Piezano for $100: This TikTok-popular oven is affordable, small, and convenient. It looks a little like a waffle iron, and comes with handy double paddles for easier placement. Astonishingly, its claims of heating the top and bottom elements to 800 degrees Fahrenheit are accurate, and it takes about 15 minutes, which allows for short cook times. But note the heating element at the top doesn't cover the whole surface area, so you have to rotate your pies pretty frequently. Also, opening the top like a waffle maker means that it doesn't retain heat very well. It dropped by 100 to 200 degrees between pies and requires a bit of recovery time.\n\nAlso Tested\n\nPhotograph: Matthew Korfhage\n\nCurrent Backyard Model P for $699: No less a TV food personage than Alton Brown has signed on as an endorser of this 1,750-watt electric indoor/outdoor pizza oven, which will heat to 850 degrees Fahrenheit using a standard power outlet. Heat is relatively even across the oven, and it'll get up to top temp in around 30 minutes. But cook settings are constrained to a few preset levels (New-York style, thin crust, Neapolitan, frozen), whose temps and cooking times can be a bit fussy to fiddle with. The app and on-device controls tend to offer more quirks than functionality. Display temp and actual temp don't always match, and its top thermal elements turn on and off like the lights in a David Lynch movie, according to what the company calls a proprietary algorithm. Still, you can make a great pizza on this thing, and you can make it indoors. Current says it plans to add more functions and cooking modes in future updates, and we'll keep testing. But it feels less than fully baked at the moment, especially at its price.\n\nPizzacraft Pizzaque for $130: This oven is adorable and affordable, and you can stand it in your driveway and cook a good pizza while sitting in your camp chair. However, it just doesn't get as hot or cook as evenly as a better-insulated oven does.\n\nThe Best Accessories\n\nSome pizza ovens provide you with proprietary accessories to set you on your pizza path. But we've also found a few extras to be helpful along the way:\n\nA handheld infrared thermometer for $11: Even if the oven has a built-in thermometer, a handheld infrared thermometer is a great way to check the temperature on different areas of the pizza stone. It's also important to make sure the stone has time to reheat after each pizza. For pizza purposes, this affordable one should be accurate enough to suit your needs.\n\nA wooden pizza peel for $34: If you own multiple peels, it's quick and easy to prep one pizza while another is baking. WIRED reviewers Adrienne So and Matthew Korfhage each own several peels, including a useful small turning peel. But for launching, the dough is much less likely to stick on a wooden peel, especially if you first sprinkle on some semolina or flour.\n\nA cast-iron skillet for $25: You can also use a cast-iron pan in your pizza oven to sear steaks or pan-roast broccoli. Lodge's pans work just as well as much more expensive options.\n\nHeat-resistant gloves for $20: That cast iron gets extremely hot, so you'll also need a good pair of mitts. (Even these won't protect your hands for long, so you'll need a place near the oven to set the pan down.)\n\nFire starters for $20: If you've ever been intimidated by the idea of cooking with wood, don't be! These fire starters make it quick and simple. Just light the end with a match, drop it in the fuel tray, and line up a few oak sticks on top. Be sure to keep your wood dry if you don't want to create a smoke stack in your backyard.\n\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

It might be worth waiting until next year to get one of these with Dyson's newest features, but right now none of them have a confirmed date for when they’ll be available to buy, so it's hard to know how long you'll be waiting. The new Dyson vacuums coming in 2026 include:\n\nThe Dyson PencilVac. This was announced earlier this year and is already available in Japan and Korea, but won't arrive in the US until 2026. It promises to be Dyson's slimmest vacuum yet, with a handle barely reaching 1.5 inches in diameter and a new compact motor, the Dyson Hyperdymium 140k. The motor design is based on Dyson's hair tools. It promises an hour of battery life and has a small 0.02-gallon dustbin, which Dyson promises can compact the dust and debris it picks up to make the dustbin last. One of our former writers briefly tested it and was impressed.\n\nThis was announced earlier this year and is already available in Japan and Korea, but won't arrive in the US until 2026.

This is an update to Dyson's popular V8 vacuum, with 30 percent more suction power—150 air watts—and twice the run time, giving it over an hour over the original V8's 30 minutes. It'll have a triggerless power button and a self-emptying docking station, which is the addition I'm most excited about.\n\nThis is an update to Dyson's popular V8 vacuum, with 30 percent more suction power—150 air watts—and twice the run time, giving it over an hour over the original V8's 30 minutes.

This is a new cordless stick vacuum with the latest motor, a cleaner head that can sense the floor type, and a wet roller head option like the Dyson V15's Submarine variant (the wet roller head will be aptly named the Submarine 2.0). It promises 315 air watts of power and a 70-minute run time, and will have a wipe-clean mechanism that helps get stubborn dust and long hairs out of the vacuum's bin. There's going to be a compatible self-emptying docking station that can be purchased separately.\n\nThis is a new cordless stick vacuum with the latest motor, a cleaner head that can sense the floor type, and a wet roller head option like the Dyson V15's Submarine variant (the wet roller head will be aptly named the Submarine 2.0).

It'll be filter-free and trap everything it collects in the cleaner head itself. We're curious how it'll compare to the WashG1, which it looks similar to.\n\nThis is Dyson's new wet-and-dry floor cleaner.

This will be the newest robot vacuum coming to Dyson's lineup. It uses artificial intelligence to detect stains. This vacuum will be both a robot vacuum and mop, allowing it to automatically dry- or wet-clean your floors. It also uses AI to better avoid obstacles while it cleans; navigation was an issue we noticed for the Dyson 360 Vis Nav.\n\nMore Good Dyson Vacs\n\nCourtesy of Amazon\n\nWe've tested a variety of Dyson vacuums, both corded and cordless. However, as new versions come out, older models are bumped from the top spots. But the vacs below are still worth buying, as long as you don't pay full price.\n\nDyson Ball Animal 3 for $350: If you really, really, want an upright vacuum instead of a cordless stick vacuum from Dyson, the Dyson Ball Animal 3 is the way to go. We've tested the Ball Animal 3 Extra, which has more attachments, but the regular is just as powerful. Former WIRED reviewer Jaina Grey found it performed well against the rabbit hair in her home. The downside is that it's loud and heavy.\n\nDyson Big Ball Multi Floor Vacuum for $380: This was originally one of our top picks for tight spaces. But Dyson no longer sells it and it's often out of stock at third-party retailers—unless you're OK with purchasing a used model (however, you shouldn't spend more than $250 to $300 on it). It's a good option if you're looking for more maneuverability than a stick can offer. You only have to wield a thin suction tube, as long as you don't mind periodically repositioning the canister. Dyson's Cinetic technology means there are no filters to wash or replace, and it still has HEPA-grade filtration for capturing allergens and most particulates. If you find a new model, we suggest waiting until it's on sale between $300 and $400.\n\nDyson Digital Slim for $262: This was our top pick to get a Dyson on a budget, and it's still a good option if you can find it. It's a solid basic vacuum, and kind of like an upgrade Dyson V8. It has a trigger to hold down like the V15, and comes with some accessories but not the fluffy cleaner head with the dust-spotting laser. It's smaller and lighter than other Dysons, but has a smaller dustbin, and is best to find on sale. Right now it's only available used on Amazon.\n\nDyson Omni-Glide for $450: The Dyson Omni-Glide is a good Dyson vacuum if you have only hard floors in your home. It's nice and small, with a super maneuverable head that can reach spots only a broom usually can. It's not as powerful as other Dysons, though, and the new vacuums to come from Dyson will likely be a better choice.\n\nDyson Outsize+ for $950: If you're looking for something bigger than the V15 Detect but don't want the larger upright model, the next step up is the Outsize+. It's still a stick style, but has twice the run time. There are two versions; both come with an LCD screen and three cleaning modes, but the newer model has the Laser Slim Fluffy cleaner head. It's looking out of stock most places, so we'll see if it comes back in stock.\n\nDyson V11 for $400: This is a solid alternative to the Cyclone V10. When WIRED reviewer Adrienne So reviewed the V11, she called it the “dream vac”. However, that was in 2019, and many updated models have come out since then. The improvements the V11 offered versus the V10 were incremental. If you can find a V11 for under $350, it’s worth it; otherwise, we recommend going with a later (or cheaper) model. If you're looking into the latest V11 Dyson offers, it's important to note it doesn't come with Dynamic Load Sensor technology (a feature that allows it to automatically adjust suction across different floor types).\n\nDyson V12 Detect Slim for $505: Dyson's V12 Detect Slim is excellent for small spaces like a studio or a one-bedroom apartment since it's compact, lightweight, and a great size for hard-to-reach spots and minimal storage. There's an LCD screen, a run time of up to 60 minutes, and a charging time of up to 4.5 hours.\n\nDyson WashG1 for $698: The WashG1 is Dyson's first dedicated wet floor cleaner. It comes equipped with two very absorbent microfiber rollers that rotate counter to each other and a pump that distributes water evenly from a 27-ounce tank via 26 pulse-modulated water outlets. It's fantastic for cleaning floors, but the tray is gross and messy to clean, and mine grew mold at one point.\n\nFAQs and How-Tos\n\nWhat Does Dyson’s Terminology Mean? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Dyson doesn't stick to chronological order when naming its stick models. Sometimes it skips numbers, and sometimes it'll introduce a lower number as a later model than a higher number. For example, Dyson introduced the V15 immediately after the V11, and then the V12 after the V15. In the broadest sense, the numbers seem to loosely grow larger with each passing release—the V11 is newer than the V10, and the V10 is newer than the V8. But Dyson's naming system is cryptic enough that even we can't predict what the subsequent model will be. Dyson also has a lot of sub-models, because its naming scheme isn't confusing enough. Each one has a different number of included tool attachments and accessories. Every model (V7, V8, V10, V11, V15, etc.) seems to introduce new sub-models, so the list just keeps growing, and then there are discontinued sub-models that show up as old stock on websites, typically on sale. Detect isn't exactly a sub-model, but rather part of the name of the V15 Detect and V12 Detect Slim. It refers to the laser detection system that measures particle size and count to customize suction power. Absolute is usually the king-of-the-hill version with the most attachments. We can't list them all, because they vary based on parent model, but expect a variety of brush nozzles, crevice attachments, and motorized roller heads to scrub tough grit off hard floors and out of deep-pile carpets. Allergy used to mean that it came with an upgraded filter that traps 99.99 percent of bacteria and dust, so it expels cleaner air than regular models, but after the V7, all Dyson stick vacs started including the upgraded filters. It's largely a legacy designation now, and it hasn't been used on newer models. Motorhead sounds fancy, but it's the low-end sub-model that comes with a motorized head, a couple of basic brush and crevice tools, and that's about it. It's mostly a holdover from the V7 days. Dyson has found other names for basic sub-models. Origin, Fluffy, and Animal come with relatively few attachments. The Fluffy and Animal don't come with any unique attachments particular to usefulness in cleaning up after pets; it's just become shorthand for \"base model with fewer attachments.\" The same is true for the Origin, although its name makes more sense. Dyson isn't above combining sub-model names. The more names Dyson slaps onto a model, the more attachments it comes with. For example, the V8 Animal Pro comes with more stuff than the Animal, but the Animal Pro+ comes with even more than that. What Are the Dyson Accessory Bundles? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron You will also notice that we mention the different accessories in each model, which vary depending on the model you buy. These make your vacuum more versatile, making it easier to tackle specific parts of the house. If your vac doesn't come with an accessory you want, you can always purchase it separately. But it can be tough to discern which one does what, especially if this is your first Dyson. (Save on top Dyson vacuums and accessory bundles with our exclusive Dyson promo codes.) Below, we break down some of the most common accessories Dyson offers and what each one is specifically designed for. For cordless vacuums: Motorbar cleaner head: This one comes equipped with 43 detangling vanes that automatically wrap hair from the brush bar as you clean your floors. That way, you don't have to worry about it getting stuck on the cleaner head itself. It's compatible with the Dyson V8 and Dyson Cyclone V10 range.\n\nThis one comes equipped with 43 detangling vanes that automatically wrap hair from the brush bar as you clean your floors. That way, you don't have to worry about it getting stuck on the cleaner head itself. It's compatible with the Dyson V8 and Dyson Cyclone V10 range. Fluffy Optic cleaner head: This one comes with an angled blade of light that Dyson says shows you “twice the amount” of invisible dust on hard floors as its predecessor (which is compatible with the V15 Detect and V11). It's ideal for darker flooring where dust can be hard to spot. It's compatible with the Gen5Outsize and Gen5Detect.\n\nThis one comes with an angled blade of light that Dyson says shows you “twice the amount” of invisible dust on hard floors as its predecessor (which is compatible with the V15 Detect and V11).

Hair screw tool: Similar to the motorbar cleaner head, this is an anti-tangle conical brush that picks up both long hair and pet hair. But it's designed for small spaces—I use it on the couch and my sheets to pick up loose strands. It's compatible with the Dyson Cyclone V10, V11 (including the models with click-in battery), V15 Detect, V15 Detect Submarine, and V8 (with star pre-filter).\n\nSimilar to the motorbar cleaner head, this is an anti-tangle conical brush that picks up both long hair and pet hair.

You can see the full list here. It's currently out of stock but you can sign up to be notified via email when it's back. Carbon-fiber soft dusting brush: This brush is built to pick up fine dust on more delicate surfaces like blinds, lampshades, mirrors, and more. It also has a self-adjusting brush plate that automatically adjusts suction to maximize the amount of dust it picks up. It's compatible with the Dyson DC47, Ball Animal, Ball, Ball Animal 2, and Multi Floor 2.\n\nThis brush is built to pick up fine dust on more delicate surfaces like blinds, lampshades, mirrors, and more.

For more options, you can check out Dyson's official site, which lists accessories for both cordless and upright vacuums. What About Replacement Parts? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron When unboxing your new vacuum, we recommend downloading Dyson's companion app—MyDyson (iOS, Android)—and registering your device to activate your warranty, which is two years for cordless models and five years for corded. The coverage goes into effect on the day you buy it, as long as you have proof of purchase. If you don't, the warranty will kick in 90 days after the manufacture date. The warranty covers replacement parts (including batteries and certain parts), repairs (Dyson will collect the machine free of charge, or you can visit one of its Service Centers), and replacements. If the repairs can't be done, Dyson will fully replace it for you. You can check here for a full list of what it does and doesn't cover. When your warranty is up, you'll have to buy the replacement parts. Dyson offers spare filters, batteries, chargers, specific parts (V-ball wheels, axles and rollers, and rear edges), and accessories for purchase. You can go directly through Dyson's site (which is accessible via the app), but stock fluctuates depending on the specific part you're looking for. You can also purchase them through authorized sellers like Amazon and Walmart. If you're looking elsewhere, it's important to make sure these parts are genuine Dyson parts (you can do this by checking that Dyson is the retailer through the third-party seller you're purchasing from). Dyson offers a 12-month warranty on its genuine parts, and those sold by other brands may not be covered. Inauthentic parts may not fit or work properly either—regardless of whether the seller claims they're compatible—and could damage the vacuum entirely. I made the mistake of ordering new filters through a third-party seller for the Dyson V15 I was testing at the time, only to find they were too small. How Do You Clean a Dyson Vacuum? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Dyson vacuums are expensive, so it's important to maintain yours—this helps to increase its longevity and maintain its powerful suction. If you have a cordless model, the company suggests cleaning the filter once a month (at least). You can clean the filter (on both cordless and upright models) by removing it, tapping lightly on the side of your garbage bin or sink, and rinsing it with cold tap water (Dyson says not to use any detergents). Then, fill the filter with warm tap water, cover the open sides with your hands, and shake it firmly to remove dirt. You should repeat these steps until the water runs clear, at which point you can then shake the filter to get rid of any excess water. You should then let the filter dry for at least 24 hours in an area that has airflow (like near a fan or open window). Once it's fully dry, you can place it back into the body. To clean the canister, use a damp microfiber cloth. You can also clean the roller cleaner head by cutting away any hair using scissors (depending on the Dyson you have, you might need to use a screwdriver to remove the plate on the cleaner head). If your model comes with a soft brush bar, you can clean that too. Remove it from the cleaner head (take the end cap off too), hold it under running water while gently rubbing it to remove dirt and lint, and let it dry for 24 hours. If you're using an upright vac, you can also clean the hose by running it under warm water. As with the rest of the parts, you should let it dry for 24 hours before reattaching it. How Do You Set Up a Dyson Mount? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Dyson's cordless vacs don't stand upright, but the battery has a flat back so that you can rest it against a wall. However, it's not the most stable. If you don't lean it just right, it'll slide off the wall and hit the ground. The company includes a wall dock with every model. There's also a spot to place the charging cable so that the device is always charging while placed on the dock. It's simple to install (you may need a drill), but it's the most ideal storage solution. Here are the steps on how to install it: Make sure you have all the proper accessories: the front casing, back plate, screws, charger, and wall plug. Drill two holes in the wall based on the recommended measurements in the manual. Grab the backplate and secure it with the screws. Place the jack plug on the front casing and make sure the charging cable is secured behind the front casing. Push the jack cover down to make sure the jack plug is secure. Clip the front casing onto the backplate and push it in to secure it. Plug the wall plug into an outlet and you're all set. From there, you can attach the vacuum to the wall dock. For visuals on how to install it, you can also watch Dyson's step-by-step video. Does Dyson Come Out With New Models Every Year? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Not always. There's no cycle of when Dyson will come out with new products, and whether a new model will replace something in the lineup or just add onto the existing one. Some of Dyson's newest vacuums don't launch in every market right away, either—the Digital Slim was available only in Asia for a few years, and the new PencilVac announced earlier this year is only available in Japan right now. How Does WIRED Test Vacuums? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron WIRED tests vacuums within home environments to see how they'd work for day to day messes and buildup. We test them on carpets, rugs, staircases, and hard floors like hardwood, vinyl, and tile to see how well they do at picking up dust, dirt, and debris. We also make sure to test every attachment for its intended use, but the main focus is using the vacuum itself like a normal person would to see if if it's worth investing in. How Does WIRED Acquire Its Review Samples? What Happens to Them After Testing? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron WIRED acquires review samples in a handful of ways: they can be provided by a company (though if provided, we don't promise coverage or what that coverage will be) or purchased by WIRED. Writers can also write about items they've purchased themselves. For this guide, all of these picks were all provided as review samples for WIRED staffers to test. After we're done testing, samples are either returned, donated, or held onto for long-term testing. Dysons are a category we like to long-term test since there isn't very much turnover in the lineup, making it possible for us to spend longer testing a Dyson without needing to move on to the model that replaced it.\n\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

    "summary": "Comparing Our Favorite Kindles What About the New Kindle Scribes?",
    "text": "Comparing Our Favorite Kindles\n\nWhat About the New Kindle Scribes?\n\nCourtesy of Amazon\n\nAmazon announced not one, not two, but three new Kindle Scribes at its fall hardware event. The lineup will now be the third-gen Kindle Scribe ($430), Kindle Scribe With Frontlight ($550), and Kindle Scribe Colorsoft ($630). These new Kindles are promised to be faster and thinner than the current model, but the most exciting part is getting a Kindle Scribe with a color screen—and the slew of new features coming to these models.\n\nThose new features will include an AI-powered notebook search, a new digital scratch pad called Quick Notes, and Kindle Workspace, which allows you to compile books, documents, and files in one workspace and send files to or from platforms like OneDrive and Google Drive. There's also Story So Far, which will recap the book you're reading to the point you're at, and Ask This Book, which lets you ask questions about characters, plot lines, and story arc. Amazon says both tools are spoiler-free.\n\nThe Kindle Scribe With Frontlight and Scribe Colorsoft will launch later this year, and the basic version will be available early next year. We'll update these guides with our thoughts once we test these new devices.\n\nAccessories for Easier Reading\n\nPhotograph: Nena Farrell\n\nIf you've ever had a long reading session that gives you hand cramps, these accessories might help. You can check out more options in our Best Kindle Accessories guide.\n\nStrapsicle E-Reader Hand Straps for $20: Attach one or both of these to the back of your Kindle—one is angled for your right hand and the other for your left—and slide your hand in. Your hands won't cramp, you won't accidentally hit the screen and flip pages, and the reader won't slip out of your hands. There are three sizes meant to hold different types of e-readers. You should see exactly which models they work with on the Amazon pages, as well as on this page on the Strapsicle website.\n\nLamicall Gooseneck Tablet Holder for $18: I love this device. While I wouldn't call it completely hands-free, it’s a super convenient and comfortable experience, particularly if you have chronic pain in your wrists. The clamp is easy to attach to bed frames and side tables (there’s also a floor stand version for $60). It’s lightweight to deploy anywhere and has enough resistance to the neck that it doesn’t fall forward or out of the position you place it in. It did wobble a bit when I touched it to turn the page (or it got bumped by a curious cat), so I usually keep a rest hand on it to hold it steady. If you want to go fully hands-free, add a page-turner remote so you can read without lifting a finger.\n\nPopSockets PopGrips starting at $10: PopSockets PopGrips aren't just for your phone. They also work great on e-readers if paired with a MagSafe case or adhesive ring. The more affordable PopSockets work with adhesive, while the more expensive ones use MagSafe adapters, letting you take them on and off without leaving sticky residue behind. My personal favorite is the Heart of Silver ($40), since it's a larger PopSockets and I have small hands. The Heart of Silver one makes the seven-inch Kindle Paperwhite and Colorsoft really comfortable to hold, and comes with an adapter ring to convert any case you have into a MagSage one.\n\nNomad 65W Slim Power Adapter for $55: Kindles have long battery life, but former WIRED reviewer Brenda Stolyar liked to carry a charger with her on the go just in case. This one from Nomad is her favorite. It's super thin and comes with two USB-C ports, so she uses it to charge her e-reader and phone simultaneously (the left side delivers 45 watts and the right delivers 20 watts when charging two devices at the same time). The prongs also fold up, so it fits nicely in the side pocket of a bag.\n\nBest Kindle Cases & Covers\n\nPhotograph: Nena Farrell\n\nAmazon Kindles are, thankfully, not as fragile as our pricey smartphones, but you may still want to add a cover to protect the screen if you're frequently toting it around in a bag. These aren't padded for serious drops, but are the best Kindle cases we've found for daily protection from scratches and scuffs. The Kids' editions come with cases.\n\nPopSockets PopCase Kindle for $40: These Kindle cases are designed with a MagSafe adapter in the back, so you can easily add a MagSafe PopSockets grip to the back. You used to have to adhere the grip or buy a MagSafe adapter to use PopSockets on your Kindle, but now you can customize freely with these cases. These cases are also a nice quality, but they don't include a cover, and the grip can only be attached to the predetermined lower center spot. If you have smaller hands like I do, get one of the bigger PopGrips, like the Heart of Silver ($40), to more easily reach it.\n\nFabric Covers for Kindle for $32 and Paperwhite for $37: These open like a book and come in some variation of black, blue, pink, or green. They're made from postconsumer recycled fabric.\n\nFabric Cover for Scribe for $60: This one flips up and over like a notepad, and you can position it into a stand, too. There's also a slot for the pen if you don't want it to attach magnetically all the time. It's also made with recycled materials.\n\nThe Bookish Kindle Cases starting at $36: I really like that this cover also has a built-in strap, so you can enjoy the security of a hand strap while reading and have the protection of a cover when you're not. There are a bunch of fun colors, too.\n\nThe Quirky Cup Collective E-Reader Sleeve for $29: Our team loves these gorgeous sleeves, particularly the Sun and Moon version. They're beautiful and will protect your device when you aren't using it, so you can throw it in your bag without worry. The outside is velvet and the inside is satin, with some padding in between and a zip closure. On the back is a small zip pocket. On each product page, you'll see which devices fit, but consult the measurements. There are also separate, larger book and iPad sleeves (starting at $35).\n\nCoBak Clear Case for $9: The best part about having a clear case is that it protects the back of your Kindle and allows you to decorate it with stickers underneath.\n\nGreat Reading Lights\n\nPhotograph: Simon Hill\n\nIf you read before bed but don't want to disturb sleeping partner, kids, or roommates, invest in a reading light. All the Kindles now have a front light, so you don't need one, but these can still be handy, especially if you switch between your e-reader and physical books. Below are a few of our favorites. You can find more in our Best Reading Lights guide.\n\nVekkia 14 LED Book Light for $16: This is our top pick. It's a clip-on light with an adjustable gooseneck and two swiveling light bars that pack seven LEDs each. You can cycle through five levels of brightness and three warm colors. It's relatively large, though, so it's not great for small paperbacks. The clamp opens as wide as 2.1 inches and serves as a stable base to place on a nightstand.\n\nGlocusent LED Neck Reading Light for $23: This reading light wraps around your neck, so it looks silly. But it's an excellent alternative to a clip-on reading light while remaining hands-free. It's lightweight, adjustable, and comes with three color temperature modes as well as six brightness settings. It's rechargeable and offers up to 80 hours of battery life at dimmer settings.\n\nAbout Those Older Kindles\n\nAmazon doesn't release new Kindles often—the company usually takes a few years between models. Whenever a new one arrives, its predecessor's stock starts to dwindle. It's not that we don't recommend these per se, but we only suggest these if you can find them on sale for the right price. Otherwise, we recommend buying the latest version.\n\nBefore making your purchase, cross-check the price with the latest model to make sure you're spending a fair amount less on the older device.\n\nKindle (2022, 11th Generation): This is the smallest of the lot at 6.2 inches tall and 4.3 inches wide, with a 6-inch screen. If you find tablets too cumbersome to hold with one hand, consider this one. With this model, Amazon doubled the storage to 16 gigabytes and upgraded the display to 300 pixels per inch (PPI) resolution (up from 167 PPI). It's tough to find, but if you manage to snag one, you shouldn't spend more than $50.\n\nThis is the smallest of the lot at 6.2 inches tall and 4.3 inches wide, with a 6-inch screen.

It has a bright 6.8-inch screen with adjustable warm lighting, a fast page-turn rate, a USB-C port, and 16 gigs of storage. It's waterproof too. We like the Signature Edition, which also includes auto-adjust brightness and 32 gigabytes of storage. Don't recommend spending more than $100 if you can find them.\n\nThis is the next step up from the basic model.

Kindle Scribe (1st Generation): The original Scribe is a great option for note-takers. It has a giant 10.2-inch screen for taking notes, marking up PDFs, or drawing, and numerous paper formats you can choose, like college-ruled or dotted. It also comes with the Basic Pen, which feels natural to write with and attaches to the side of the Scribe magnetically. It's only worth it for $230 or less.\n\nThe original Scribe is a great option for note-takers.

Are you looking at a used one for sale? If you're trying to figure out what model it is, this Amazon page includes photos, specs, and release years for the entire lineup. Once you know which one you have, you may be able to trade it in for credit toward a newer model. Most old Kindles probably still work, just with fewer bells and whistles. It's best to avoid Kindles with keyboards or any other physical buttons other than page-turn buttons. Some older models lost the ability to browse, purchase, or borrow new books directly from the device. However, you'll still be able to do this via Amazon.com on your computer or phone and have it sent to your Kindle, which is a better experience anyway. These models include the Kindle 2nd Generation (International), Kindle DX International, Kindle DX Graphite, Kindle Keyboard, Kindle 4th Generation, and Kindle 5th Generation. How Do You Get Free Ebooks on a Kindle? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron If you buy every single book you want to read on a Kindle, it can add up! But there are ways to save some money while reading as much as your heart desires. You may want to subscribe to Kindle Unlimited for $12 a month. You can only choose from the Unlimited catalog, but there are millions of titles there, including audiobooks and magazines. Start out with the 30-day free trial. If you already pay for a Prime account, you're eligible for some free ebooks through Prime Reading. There are not as many options as with Kindle Unlimited, and in a lot of cases, you'll see both Unlimited and Prime options lumped together; you'll have to look closely to find the free ebooks. It's still something, and there are even a few magazines. If you don't want another monthly subscription and don't want to continue giving your money to Amazon, take advantage of the ebooks available with your library card. Browsing a digital catalog is not as magical as spending an afternoon looking over every shelf in a library, but such is the ebook life (no one says you can't read both!). We have a detailed how-to on this you should check out, but here are some of the takeaways: Get a library card for your local branch.\n\nCheck your branch's website for its ebook offerings. Many libraries use a service called OverDrive.\n\nDownload directly to your Kindle library. They'll automatically be removed when they're due back. If you know someone else with a Kindle, you can lend books between your libraries, just as you would with a physical copy. Follow these instructions from Amazon if you want to share an ebook, but keep in mind that not all books can be loaned. Do All Kindles Have Dark Mode? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Dark mode is a big appeal of any e-reader, whether it's a Kindle or another brand. And just about all models have it now that most e-readers include a front light. (Older Kindles don't always have one, so if you're getting an older refurbished one, double-check it.) However, one new model doesn't have a true dark mode: the Colorsoft. The Colorsoft can't have a full dark mode due to its screen design, according to Amazon, but instead you can switch the page color to black in the Quick Actions menu. It's not the same, though, especially if you are reading something that isn't a regular book (like a file sent to your Kindle) or want the menu pages to also be dark, you're out of luck. What Else Can a Kindle Do? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Kindles have helpful features you may want to take advantage of. Long-press a word or phrase to see its definition, highlight it, or take notes. You can also search the entire book for that particular word or phrase or translate it to or from other languages. Word Wise shows short definitions in small text within the lines. Unfortunately, it's not available for all books, but when it is, you can turn it on or off and choose more and fewer hints. Clicking the short definition opens a longer one from Word Wise and the New Oxford American Dictionary or Oxford Dictionary of English (you can switch between the two), plus translations, and a Wikipedia page, if applicable. While reading, tap the top of the screen and click “Aa” to change font size or type—there's even a font called OpenDyslexic that helps make reading easier for people with dyslexia. You can control margin sizes and line spacing from that menu too. When a Kindle is connected to a Bluetooth speaker or headphones, VoiceView Screen Reader (accessed through Settings > Accessibility) allows you to use gestures to navigate your device and reads aloud what you've pressed. It will also read a book aloud, though it doesn't sound nearly as nice as an audiobook. Amazon owns Goodreads, so it syncs seamlessly to Kindles (press the three-dot menu > Goodreads). If you have a Goodreads account, you can review the Kindle books you've read or browse your bookshelf and recommendations. Long-pressing a word or phrase, in addition to what is mentioned above, opens up an option to share quotes directly to Goodreads. There's a web browser too if you're connected to the internet (three-dot menu > Web Browser). It's not the best, so I'd reserve it for emergency searches. Is This a Good Time to Buy a Kindle? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron The best time to buy a Kindle is during a major sale event like Amazon Prime Day or Black Friday, because Amazon often has steep discounts. Amazon Prime Day (and Amazon Big Deals Day, which it named this year's October sale event) has passed, but Black Friday and Cyber Monday are only a few weeks away. Amazon refreshed its line of Kindles just last year, so we don't expect any to be replaced any time soon except for the Kindle Scribe, which Amazon announced in September will have three new models later this year and early next year. Still, those models will cost more than the current one, which you'll likely find on sale for both Prime Day and Black Friday ahead of the new Kindle Scribe's launch. I recommend buying the current model while you can if you don't want to spend more than $500, which is what the new models coming out this year will retail for. There will be a cheaper one next year, but it won't have a front light, which the second-generation Scribe that's currently available does have for a cheaper price. The only reason to wait to buy a new model is if you want a color option, as one of the new models will be the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft ($630), Amazon's first-ever color screen Scribe device.\n\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

    "text": "Merino wool is a super fiber. The best merino wool clothing somehow manages to be comfortable in 95-degree heat, and merino base layers keep you warm well below freezing. Unlike synthetic fibers derived from petroleum, merino wool is natural and renewable.\n\nMerino wool’s versatility means there’s a bewildering array of blends and options to choose from. Here are our favorite merino wool products that we've tested by wearing and washing (usually in cold water, and hung to dry, although we do machine dry them just to see what happens) over the course of months and even years in some cases. Once you're done here, don't forget to check out the rest of our apparel guides, like the Best Merino Wool T-Shirts, Best Base Layers, Best Puffer Jackets, Best Hoodies, and Best Hiking Boots.\n\nUpdated November 2025: We’ve added several new T-shirts from Huckberry's Proof brand and Taylor Stitch, a Minus33 base layer for extreme cold, Ridge Merino's excellent Cloudripper merino-grid fleece blend, Wool&'s Roam Convertible Wrap Bra, and Proper Cloth's exquisite dress shirt.\n\nWhy Is Merino Wool So Great? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Merino wool is great because you're stealing a sheep's ability to keep itself warm or cool based on the temperatures it's in, a process often referred to as thermoregulation. If you've only ever worn the sort of itchy wool sweaters your proverbial grandmother supposedly made, you might wonder what all the fuss is. The answer is that Merino sheep have thinner, softer wool, which has evolved to keep them comfortable across a wide range of temperatures and is comfortable to wear next to your skin. Wool is sustainable, too. One sheep can produce 4 to 5 pounds of wool per year. That's because the sheep that make merino wool drink only the purest alpine waters and study the art of comfort under the tutelage of those stuck-up Pashmina goats, who, let's face it, might know a thing or two about wonderfully pillowy softness. Just kidding. Merino sheep do have that softer wool though, and merino wool is a remarkable fabric that's become the cornerstone of my wardrobe. What Does GSM Mean? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Merino wool comes in different weights, which you will frequently see listed as “200 gsm” or something similar. (The “gsm” refers to grams per square meter, sometimes listed as g/m.) What's important is the scale and where your garment falls on it. At the low end, you have T-shirts and underwear, which are typically 150 gsm, though we have seen some as low as 120 gsm. Generally, anything below 200 gsm will be a good base layer or T-shirt. From 200 to 300 gsm are your mid-layers, and anything above 300 is a heavier garment. If you're more familiar with synthetic ratings like those often used on fleece, know that, in my experience, about 120–160 gsm wool corresponds to 100-weight fleece, 160–200 gsm wool roughly matches 200-weight fleece and 200+ wool is like 300-weight fleece. In every instance, the wool is warmer because it's better at trapping heat, especially in the wind. (That said, there are reasons to go with fleece at times, like how incredibly lightweight it can be.) What Is Nuyarn? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Nuyarn is a merino wool/synthetic hybrid weave, wherein merino wool is wrapped around a nylon core for warmth, lightness, and extra durability. The idea is to get the temperature regulation benefits of merino, but to add some of the longevity of nylon. In my experience, Nuyarn mostly works. It's our top pick for base layers, though I find it less necessary in more casual garments, where I prefer 100 percent wool. How to Care for Merino Wool AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Most merino products will have care instructions. Most likely it will be to wash cold and lay flat to dry. The latter is important, as hanging wool to dry will stretch it out (because of the water weight). While most merino labels say the garment can be machine washed, my experience has been that hand-washing merino will extend its life. This is particularly true of very lightweight (150 gsm) merino base layers and T-shirts. The exception is Minus33's Microweight Raglan short sleeve T-shirt, which is machine-washable and dryer-friendly. Having done both to mine for over a year, I can vouch that it does indeed hold up. I've never had a problem storing merino in my closet between wears, but for long-term storage, I recommend you take precautions against moths, which are notorious for eating holes in wool. I have lost merino garments to moths. If you don't want to smell like mothballs, there are better solutions. I make sure to wash and thoroughly dry whatever I am storing, then I seal it in a compression bag, like this. Another option is to put your merino garment in a cotton bag or otherwise wrap it in cotton and then put it in a plastic bin. It's very important to make sure that the garment is completely dry before using any of these storage methods, otherwise your wool will smell musty and moldy. Other options include storing your garment in a cedar chest, which is a good natural deterrent for moths, or use moth traps or lavender sachets, which will repel the moths. 100 Percent Merino vs. Blends AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Should you buy 100 percent merino or should you go for a blend? The answer is … it depends. On the garment in question, the use case, and your preferences. Probably the best way to find out is to try several and see what you like. One advantage to blends is that they're stretchy, which makes them better for active pursuits like hiking, rock climbing and the like. I like 100 percent merino for heavier mid-layers like hoodies or jackets, but I prefer blends for lighter layers. My experience has been that the closer I get to my skin, the more blend I want, with Nuyarn being my top pick for base layers. There are also some alpaca blends out there that are also wonderfully soft (I love everything I've tried from Paka and Arms of Andes). If you're one of the rare people who do find merino itchy, you might be allergic to lanolin, which is the skin oil produced by sheep. Alpacas don't make lanolin, and the fibers are thinner and finer than merino. That makes alpaca warmer and softer, but it's also more expensive. Merino vs. Synthetic Fibers AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Which is better? The answer again is … it depends (sorry). But usually merino. By synthetics, I generally mean polyester, nylon, polypropylene, rayon, or blends of these and other fabrics—everything but cotton, wool, and linen. Synthetics generally win for wicking away sweat, which means they tend to feel drier. They also tend to dry faster, so when it comes to things like socks and underwear, even most \"merino\" options are often more than 50 percent synthetic. Synthetics are just better at handling moisture. How much this matters depends on a host of personal factors. For example, I feel weird and almost clammy in anything synthetic, so I don't really care how much moisture it wicks away. The downside to that moisture wicking is that synthetics retain odor. There are some chemical treatments that can help, but I've never tried anything synthetic that was as odor-resistant as merino wool. Another difference is breathability. Synthetics are passable in this department, but it's where merino really excels. If you're hot and are hiking up an exposed slope toward an open pass and then dropping down into the cool of a forest, merino is your friend, because the breathability means less sweat to cool you when you get out of the sun. Again, how much this matters depends on your body. The final factor worth thinking about is durability. In some cases, synthetics will last longer than pure merino, particularly in scenarios where abrasion is a major source of wear. To my mind, this is just another reason to choose a merino blend rather than going all the way to synthetics, but it's something to think about if you do a lot of off-trail hiking or rock climbing—any activity where your clothes are going to take a beating.\n\nBase Layers\n\nTo really see how remarkable merino wool is, start at the bottom, with the clothes next to your skin. Merino really shines as a base layer. It's warmer for the weight, wicks moisture well, and unlike synthetic fabrics, merino stays stink-free for days of wear. Be sure to read our layering guide for more on how to put it all together and stay comfortable in any weather. We also have a separate guide to the best base layers if you want know all your options, but here are our top merino picks from that guide.\n\nBest Lightweight Base Layer\n\nIbex Woolies Pro Tech base layer crew is the best lightweight merino base layer we've tested. If you want a hard-wearing shirt, this it it. Woolies are Nuyarn (see above), which is 85 percent merino wool and 15 percent nylon—the merino wool is wrapped around a nylon core, which increases the warmth while being lighter (5 oz for the men's large) and more durable. This is my top pick for all things technical. It's what I bring hiking, backpacking, and it's reviews editor Adrienne So's pick for running, climbing and other high-aerobic activities when it’s cold. I also love the Woolies Pro Tech Bottoms ($115), which are what I bring backpacking in all but the warmest of weather. There’s also a quarter zip version of the shirt if you prefer.\n\nAside from comfort and warmth, a bit part of the reason we recommend Woolies is that they last. Ibex is what passes for a heritage company in this space; the company was founded in 1997 and has been cranking out merino garment for a long time. Adrienne's parents bought her two sets of Ibex base layers in 2001 that she still wears today, in the year of our Lord 2025. Properly cared for, Woolies will keep you comfortable warm for years to come.\n\nBest Heavyweight Base Layer\n\nWhen I want something a bit warmer than the lightweight Woolies above, I reach for Smartwool's Classic long sleeve base layer. These may be the most popular merino shirts around, and for good reason: They're very comfortable, tending to the looser side, feature heavy duty seams that don't rub, and sit off the shoulder for more comfort when wearing a pack. At 87 percent merino wool (blended with nylon), these are also very durable while remaining lightweight (10.3 oz for a men's large). This Smartwool shirt, along with the matching pants ($115), are great for chilly winter days.\n\nBest Everyday Base Layer\n\nThe picks above all have what my wife calls “that sporty look,” which the industry refers to as “technical.” This 100 percent merino shirt from Unbound is the opposite: it just looks like a long sleeve shirt. It's incredibly soft and while it does pill a bit if you run it through the dryer (don't), it's proved itself plenty durable—I've been wearing it constantly for over a year now and it still looks like it did when I got it. It's the long-sleeve, base layer twin to our favorite T-shirt (see below). It's on the thin side for a base layer, which makes it perfect for those cool weather mornings in the shoulder seasons. It's versatile too; it can be used as a base layer, but it also works as a T-shirt when it's not too chilly. Fit runs true to size, and if the one you want is sold out, be patient; Unbound frequently updates its stock.\n\nOther Great Base Layers:\n\nThere are so many! Here's a few more to consider, but really, go read the base layer guide.\n\nCourtesy of Ridge Merino Ridge Merino Aspect High Rise Base Layer Bottoms $80 Ridge Merino (Women's) These are another great option fro women looking for something that can be worn around town as well as on the trail. My daughter has even worn them under shorts for no-gi juijitsu and they've held up great, which is a testament to their durability. Courtesy of Minus 33\n\nPhotograph: Scott Gilbertson Chevron Chevron Minus33 Heavyweight Yukon Thermal Long Sleeve $150 Minus 33 (Men's) $150 Minus 33 (Women's) If you're going to be in extreme cold, New Hampshire-based Minus33 is the company to shop. Where I live winter temps regularly dip below 0F and the Yukon comes into its own. The 400 gsm weave of 100 percent merino is more like a sweatshirt than a base layer, but if you live in the north, you need it.\n\nMerino Mid Layers\n\nFleece has its place, but I rarely wear it these days. I prefer merino for my mid layers. It's better at helping your body regulate its temperature. The one place fleece still wins for me is backpacking, it's almost always lighter for comparable warmth, at least in mid layers.\n\nThe Best Merino Hoodie\n\nLike the Northern Lights or the McRib, the thickest Ibex wool hoodie appears irregularly and with some fanfare. The Mammoth Hoodie is indeed a big, furry beast of a garment—it's basically the weight of the classic American Giant hoodie but made of 85 percent wool cut with 15 percent nylon for added warmth and stretch. Ibex says it's the warmest hoodie they've ever made, and in my week of testing, I've used it in place of a jacket in mid-30s temps. It has an athletic cut with zippered pockets and thumb holes. I do wear a stocking hat with it in the cold because the scuba hood is meant to fit under a helmet which means it's too small to provide enough warmth for my large shaved head on its own. —Martin Cizmar\n\nOther Great Hoodies:\n\nCourtesy of Ibex Ibex Indie Hoodie $170 Ibex (Men's) $170 Ibex (Women's) WIRED's commerce director, Martin Cizmar, tested this midweight wool hoodie and says it's now one of his \"absolute favorite pieces of clothing.\" See what good wool does for you? Makes you a fan. The cut on this one is sporty but not too tight that you can't layer under it. The thumb loops, zippable tall neck, and hood make it a lot more versatile than a typical wool long-sleeve shirt. Courtesy of Ridge Merino Ridge Merino Hyde Full Zip Hoodie $160 Ridge Merino (Men's) $160 Ridge Merino (Women's) This 100 percent merino wool hoodie uses a 275 gsm terry weave merino that doesn't feel like wool. Like the Icebreaker, it's a midweight hoodie, perfect for those cool days in autumn and spring. It features a full length zipper, thumb holes in the sleeves and zipper on the pocket. The Hyde is cut on the longer side, which makes it look a little large, even though it isn't.\n\nA Hoodie for Kids\n\nThere's a dearth of merino wool for kids. Perhaps the price for something that kids may outgrow in a few months makes the economics unappealing for manufacturers. Whatever the case, very few companies offer kids-size merino. In fact, this Minus33 hoodie isn't available in kids' sizes, but the extra-small women's fit my 10-year-old perfectly and continues to fit her as an 11-year-old. You'll want to check the fit chart on Minus33 for your own kids, but if they do fit, this is a fantastic hoodie. It's plenty warm (and my daughter is always cold) and durable enough to stand up to kid life, climbing trees, and running through the woods, and the hand warmers pair well with mittens on cold days. Best of all when kids are involved, this one can be machine-washed and tumble-dried. It won't shrink or lose its shape, and the colors won't bleed.\n\nBest Mid Layer Jackets\n\nThe Best Merino Jacket\n\nA growing number of studies have shown that there are PFAs—hormone-disrupting chemicals that are commonly used in a number of plastics—in ordinary sportswear, like leggings and sports bras. If you, like me, are on a quest to replace your polyester clothing with natural fibers, then Ibex’s 100 percent merino wool Shak Jacket is the natural candidate to replace your (my) worn-out Patagonia Better Sweater ($159).\n\nI took this jacket on a trip this spring to Ireland. It’s surprisingly dense and soft to the touch. It kept me warm on blustery 30-degree days, layered easily under my rain jacket and over my tank top, and looked sleek enough to go out to dinner. In western Ireland, at least (“I like your jumper!” said many an Irishman). It doesn't pack down quite as compactly as a synthetic layer might, nor is it as light, but it looks much nicer and it won't feel like slime on your skin when it gets wet. (The full-zip version is currently out of stock, but Ibex notes that it will be back soon.) —Adrienne So\n\nThe Best Grid Fleece Merino Jacket\n\nGrid fleece is awesome. It's warm for the weight, and very breathable, making it great for highly aerobic activities. Despite all that I prefer the comfort of merino, and bring my merino mid layers backpacking even though there's a definite weight penalty. Thanks to Ridge Merino's Cloudripper jacket though, I can now have my merino and eat my grid fleece too. Ridge has combined grid fleece with merino wool to give you the advantages of both, keeping the merino against your skin, but using grid fleece to improve ventilation and make the jacket much lighter. The men's large I've been testing weighs just 16.1 ounces on my scale. That's 4 ounces more than Patagonia's R1 Air hoodie ($189), probably the most popular grid fleece jacket out there, but I have found the Cloudripper to be considerably warmer than the Air.\n\nThe Cloudripper jackets (there's also a 1/2 zip version and a crew neck version) are made of two fabrics. The first is wool grid fleece (265 gsm) which is 69 percent merino, 15 percent recycled polyester, 13 percent nylon, and 3 percent spandex. The secondary fabric is a grid fleece(180 gsm) that's 51 percent recycled polyester, 41 percent Merino wool, and 8 percent lycra. The more traditional grid fleece with the higher polyester count is used mainly on the hood and lower back, while everything that would touch your skin (if you don't have on a base layer) is merino.\n\nI've been testing the full zip Cloudripper for about a month now, and it's quickly become my go-to mid layer on the cool fall mornings and evenings that have settled in where I live. It's proven itself on some early morning bike rides, where it strikes a balance between keeping me warm when I'm first starting out, and venting off the excess heat I'm generating once I get going. It also doesn't get stinky like my purely polyester grid fleece. I'm still in the process of putting together a dedicated guide to mid layers, but the Cloudripper is an early contender for best grid fleece. It's the best of grid fleece, married to the best of merino wool to create what might be the ultimate technical mid layer.\n\nIf you have concerns about using goose down jackets as an insulation layer, merino wool is also a decent substitute for synthetic insulation. Vests are like the cheat code of layering if you like to keep your core warm but your arms mobile, or you want to get an extra soupçon of warmth without adding too much bulk. I like to layer Ibex's Wool Aire Vest under my regular wool coat or rain shell, if I'm going out for the night or on a long run. —Adrienne So\n\nThe Best Merino Wool T-Shirts\n\nWool might not seem like a good choice for a summer T-shirt, but merino is surprisingly comfortable even when it's warm. To a point anyway. On humid days over about 90 degrees Fahrenheit, I usually go with cotton or linen, but anything under 90 and I'm wearing merino. There are far a ton of merino T-shirts out there, so many in fact that we now have a guide dedicated to just the best merino t-shirts. Here are our favorites from that guide.\n\nThe Best All-Around Merino T-Shirt\n\nHuckberry's Proof-brand 72-hour Merino T-Shirt is my favorite all-around merino tee. The cut and style are not overly sporty, making it more versatile than a more technical tee. It's an incredibly soft T-shirt, thanks to the 150-gsm weave of superfine merino wool (16.5 micron). It's a blend, 87 percent merino and 13 percent nylon, which gives it some stretch—with the trade-off that it will start smelling sooner than a 100 percent merino T-shirt. In the year or so I've been wearing it, I've found the name accurate. You can get about three days out of it before it needs a wash (depending on ambient temps and what you're doing, but generally speaking this one will go three days).\n\nI really like that this shirt comes in a wide variety of colors, more than any other shirt I've tested. Proof uses the exact same fabric to make long sleeve tees, as well as polos and henleys, if you're looking for something more than a T-shirt.\n\nThe Best Technical Merino Wool T-Shirt\n\nCourtesy of Minus33 Minus33 Micro Weight Men's Wool Raglan T-Shirt $70 Amazon $70 Minus33\n\nOK, but what about when you do want a more technical cut, with flatlock stitching and offset seams? When I'm heading out hiking, backpacking, paddleboarding, just about anything outdoors, this is the T-shirt I reach for first. It's lightweight (84 percent 145-gsm merino, 16 percent synthetic) jersey knit is soft and comfortable—not too hot in the sun (it's also UPF Rating 20), warm enough when it's cool. It's also durable (I've been rolling jiu jitsu in this shirt for years and it's fine) and machine washable. You can even throw it in the dryer, no need to baby this T-shirt.\n\nThe Most Luxurious Merino T-Shirt\n\nCourtesy of Taylor Stitch Taylor Stitch The Merino Tee $85 Taylor Stitch\n\nAs I say in our guide to the best merino T-shirts, if I could have only one merino T-shirt, it would be this one. It's the softest, most luxurious merino shirt I've tested. It's 95 percent merino wool, meaning it can go quite a while before it smells, and it's great when you want to travel light—bring two of these and that's all you need in half the world. Did I mention how soft this is? It reminds me more of cashmere than merino. Taylor Stitch says that’s because it uses a mercerization process on its wool. Whatever the case, it is soft. Very, very soft. My only real gripe here is the very limited color selection. Taylor Stitch typically has a heather blue and heather black available all the time, and every now and then some other colors will be available on a very limited basis.\n\nThe Best Merino Wool T-Shirt for Travel\n\nUnbound Merino's T-shirt has long been a favorite of WIRED readers, and it's long been a favorite of travelers. It's very soft, and because it's 100 percent merino wool it'll stay odor free longer than any blended shirt. It's also lightweight and packs down to a tiny roll, which is perfect if you're looking to simplify down to one bag (really, is there any other way to travel?). I love how soft these shirts are, and they dry the fastest of any merino T-shirt I've tested.\n\nThe Best Women's Merino T-Shirt\n\nArtilect’s blend of merino wool and Tencel (a fiber made from eucalyptus) is shockingly lightweight and versatile. This summer, the Utili-Tee became my favorite shirt for climbing and backpacking. It was soft and comfortable when I was in the tree shade, and then magically stayed light and breathable when I broke through the tree line and the temperature suddenly rose by 15 degrees in the sunlight. The flat seams didn’t cause chafing on my shoulders or waist through backpack straps or a harness, and even though it’s a flattering slim fit, it didn’t constrict the movement of my shoulders or arms in any way. —Adrienne So\n\nSocks, Underwear and Bras\n\nYou could argue this is the true base layer, but we'll skip that and just say that merino wool underwear, socks, and bras are so much nicer than their synthetic counterparts. The caveat is that while merino wool is very soft, most products in this category are blends, usually with some form of nylon. Still, if you haven't tried merino underwear yet, you're in for a treat. After testing dozens of each, these are our favorites.\n\nThe Best Socks\n\nDarn Tough socks are a WIRED favorite. They're great for skiing, hiking, climbing, and just about anything else you want to do. These blends vary by weight, but most of them are around 50 percent nylon and 50 percent merino, which makes them dry a bit faster than pure merino while remaining plenty warm and comfortable. Darn Tough's socks also last. Mine are going on two years now without a worn area or hole in sight. If you do develop holes, Darn Tough socks come with a unconditionally lifetime guarantee. You can return them for another pair, no receipt needed, which is kind of crazy if you consider the abuse that hiking socks take.\n\nMinus33 socks are my personal favorite merino socks. I have several pairs of the lighweight and midweight and even one pair of the expedition, though those are so thick and warm I rarely wear them (they're perfect with the temps drop below 0F though). My favorite are the Lightweight Mountain Heritage Boot Wool Socks, which are perfect for hiking or wearing around town. Minus33 doesn't publish a blend breakdown for these, but I would guess they're about 60/40 wool to nylon, with plenty of both softness and stretch to them.\n\nThe Best Men's Merino Underwear\n\nThe phrase “wool underwear” might conjure images of some lumberjack from the 1800s with hair growing through the weaves of his itchy, hot long johns, but that's not what the merino underwear we've tested is like. In most cases these are blends, with some nylon as well.\n\nThanks to WIRED readers for pointing out Woolly to us. These 100 percent merino (190 gsm) boxers are fantastic and affordable. They ventilate well and adjust to changing conditions to keep you comfortable even on days when the weather starts hot and ends cold, or as I like to call it, hiking in the mountains. They're on the shorter side with a 4-inch inseam, but Woolly makes the same thing in a longer cut.\n\nThese are the only 100 percent merino underwear I've tested (there's elastic in the waistband, but it's surrounded by wool), and they're also some of my favorites, especially in cold weather. These are longer than any of the other boxers I've tried. These are 170 gsm, making them a little lighter, but because they merino content is higher, these are the warmest I've tested. After years of testing merino underwear, these are my favorite on all but the hottest days.\n\nOther Great Men's Underwear:\n\nCourtesy of Unbound Unbound Merino Boxers $45 Unbound Unbound's boxer briefs are very soft and comfortable. These are 84 percent merino wool, 12 percent nylon, and 4 percent Spandex, so they do have a bit of stretch to them. The 180 gsm merino is light enough for even the warmest of days. Courtesy of Icebreaker Icebreaker Merino 150 Anatomica Boxers Long $50 Icebreaker These Icebreakers are a blend like many of the others here (83 percent merino, 12 percent nylon, 5 percent elastane), but lighter weight at 150 gsm. They fit true to size. I prefer the long version linked here, but there is shorter version if you prefer.\n\nCourtesy of Ridge Merino Ridge Merino Merino Wool Boxer Briefs $36 Ridge Merino These Ridge Merino boxers are on the shorter side, but with an 83 percent merino wool blend (170 gsm), with the remainder of the fabric made of nylon and spandex. At only $36, they're a great value. They generally fit true to size, and have a 6-inch inseam. Courtesy of Ibex Ibex Natural Boxer Brief $55 Ibex These Ibex boxers are wonderfully soft and come in more colors than most of the others here, which adds some nice variety to your wardrobe. They're 83 percent merino wool, 12 percent nylon, and 5 percent elastane.\n\nThe Best Women's Merino Underwear\n\nPhotograph: Branwyn Branwyn Essential Bralette $48 Branwyn\n\nBranwyn makes what they call merino wool performance sets. I am a fan of Branwyn’s clothes, all of which are Oeko-Tex 100 certified, which means every component of the clothing has been independently tested against a list of up to 350 toxic chemicals. This is one of the most widely known and respected labels for consumer safety. These fit true to size. (I suppose it’s important to note here that I’m a small-busted woman, and that Branwyn makes a Busty Bra ($58) if you need more support.)\n\nHowever, this is not quite supportive enough to go running, which is why Branwyn launched the Racerback Bra ($75). It's pretty impressive that Branwyn got merino wool to be compressive enough for medium impact activity. I like that it offers full coverage, with no annoying small and twisty straps and no padding. It precludes the need to change from cotton “everyday” underwear to tight nylon “sport” underwear every time I want to do something active, which is all the time. —Adrienne So\n\nOther Great Women's Underwear:\n\nCourtesy of Icebreaker Icebreaker Siren Bra $50 Amazon I only have one Branwyn bra, but these are the bras that I wear every other day of my life. Like Icebreaker's men's underwear, they are 83 percent merino, 12 percent nylon, and 5 percent elastane, and they fit true to size. —Adrienne So Courtesy of Wool& Wool& Roam Convertible Wrap Bra $80 Wool& Wool&'s merino fabric is the softest I've felt in my entire life, probably because the blend has a much lower merino content at 68 percent merino wool, 25 percent nylon, and 7 percent spandex. I tried these and Wool&'s underwear. They're insanely soft but overpriced when compared to our other options, and you have to size up. —Adrienne So\n\nThe Best Everyday Merino Clothes\n\nI'll confess that when I launched this guide years ago I thought of merino wool mainly as an outdoor-related fabric. It is great for that, but I've since discovered that merino is good for everything, especially travel, since it can be worn several times without any odors. I've tried merino pants, dress shirts, workout clothes, hats, and more. The best stuff I've tested is below.\n\nThe Best Merino Dress Shirt\n\nPhotograph: Scott Gilbertson Proper Cloth Reda Merino Wool Shirt $255 Proper Cloth\n\nProper Cloth's Reda dress shirt is one of the nicest things I've ever tested. The photographs really don't do justice to how good this shirt looks in person. As you would expect from merino, the Reda is nicely breathable, much lighter and more breathable than your typical dress shirt. I found it quite comfortable even in the summer humidity. The Reda fabric is thin, though, and moisture wicking, which means you do see some arm pit sweat when it's warm. The good news is of course it won't retain any smells.\n\nI strongly suggest babying this one a little bit. I machine-washed cold and laid it flat to dry (which was quite quick), but you'll likely want to give it a light pressing to get it wrinkle free. If you're traveling, packing these down will get you a few wrinkles, but it's nothing you can't get out pretty quickly. The big question I had going in was, how durable will this be? Given the thin fabric, and the sometimes fragile nature of merino when spun this fine, I expected there to be some obvious signs of wear pretty quickly. Fortunately, I was wrong. More than three months of steady use now has done nothing to this shirt, it looks as good as the day I got it.\n\nPhotograph: Ridge Merino Ridge Merino Men's Hyde Merino Jogger $125 Ridge Merino (Men's)\n\nThese super comfy, casual sweatpants from Ridge Merino are some of the most comfortable pants I've ever worn. I don't often work out in them, I've never actually jogged in them (or yogged, it might be a soft j), but they're great around the house. These are 100 percent merino wool (275 gsm) with what Ridge calls a terry fabric (they feel like sweatpants).\n\nThis button-down long-sleeve shirt from Woolly is much more casual than the Proper Cloth shirt above. It's more what you might call business casual. It's comfortable, soft, well-made, and has the 100 percent merino advantage of being odor-resistant. The only thing I am not quite so fond of is the slightly shimmery look, but that's just personal preference.",

    "text": "The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.\n\nThe best perk of Alberto Maspero’s job, he says, is the view from his window. Situated on a hill above the ancient port city of Trieste, Italy, his office at the International School for Advanced Studies overlooks a broad bay at the northern tip of the Adriatic Sea. “It’s very inspiring,” the mathematician said. “For sure the most beautiful view I’ve ever had.”\n\nItalians call Trieste la città della bora, after its famed “bora” wind, which blows erratically down off the Alps and over the city. When the bora is strong enough, it drives the waves into reverse. Instead of breaking against the docks, they stream away from the city, back toward the open sea.\n\nBut they never actually get there. Watching from his window on these gusty days, Maspero can see the retreating waves slowly disperse as they exit the port, eventually giving way to a calm, still surface.\n\nThe equations that mathematicians use to study the flow of water and other fluids—which Leonhard Euler first wrote down nearly 300 years ago—look simple enough. If you know the location and velocity of each droplet of water, and simplify the math by assuming there’s no internal friction, or viscosity, then solving Euler’s equations will allow you to predict how the water will evolve over any time period. The rich menagerie of phenomena we see in the world’s oceans—tsunamis, whirlpools, riptides—are all solutions to Euler’s equations.\n\nBut the equations are usually impossible to solve. Even one of the simplest and most common kinds of solutions—one that describes a steady train of gently rolling waves—is a mathematical nightmare to extract from Euler’s equations. Until about 30 years ago, the bulk of what we knew about these waves came only from a mix of real-world observations and guesswork. For the most part, proofs seemed like a fantasy.\n\n“Before starting math, I thought water waves were something very understood—not a problem at all,” said Paolo Ventura, a postdoctoral fellow at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne and Maspero’s former graduate student. “But in reality, they are just strange.”",

    "text": "In a step toward the wider use of gene editing, a treatment that uses Crispr successfully slashed high cholesterol levels in a small number of people.\n\nIn a trial conducted by Swiss biotech company Crispr Therapeutics, 15 participants received a one-time infusion meant to switch off a gene in the liver called ANGPTL3. Though rare, some people are born with a mutation in this gene that protects against heart disease with no apparent adverse consequences.\n\nThe highest dose tested in the trial reduced both “bad” LDL cholesterol and triglycerides by an average of 50 percent within two weeks after treatment. The effects lasted at least 60 days, the length of the trial. The results were presented today at the American Heart Association’s annual meeting and published in The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nThe Nobel Prize–winning Crispr technology has mostly been used to address rare diseases, but these latest findings, while early, add to the evidence that the DNA-editing tool could be used to treat common conditions as well.\n\n“This will probably be one of the biggest moments in the arc of Crispr’s development in medicine,” Samarth Kulkarni, CEO of Crispr Therapeutics, tells WIRED. The company is behind the only approved gene-editing treatment on the market, Casgevy, which treats sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia.\n\nThe American Heart Association estimates that about a quarter of adults in the US have elevated LDL levels. A similar number have high triglycerides. LDL cholesterol is the waxy substance in the blood that can clog and harden arteries over time. Triglycerides, meanwhile, are the most common type of fat found in the body. High levels of both raise the risk of heart attack and stroke.\n\nThe Phase I trial was conducted in the UK, Australia, and New Zealand between June 2024 and August 2025. Participants were between the ages of 31 and 68 and had uncontrolled levels of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. The trial tested five different doses of the Crispr infusion, which took about two and a half hours on average to administer.\n\n“These are very sick people,” says Steven Nissen, senior author and chief academic officer of the Heart, Vascular and Thoracic Institute at Cleveland Clinic, which independently confirmed the trial’s results. “The tragedy of this disease is not just that people die young, but some of them will have a heart attack, and their lives are never the same again. They don't get back to work, they develop heart failure.”\n\nOne trial participant, a 51-year-old man, died six months after receiving the lowest dose of the treatment, which was not associated with a lowering of cholesterol and triglycerides. The death was related to his existing heart disease, not the experimental Crispr treatment. The man had a rare, inherited genetic form of high cholesterol and previously had several procedures to improve blood flow to his heart.",

This helps support our journalism. Learn more.\n\nFrankenstein\n\nGuillermo del Toro's long-awaited take on Mary Shelley’s foundational work of science fiction is finally here—and it’s worth the wait. You all know the tale: Hubristic, obsessed Victor Frankenstein (Oscar Isaac) seeks to conquer death itself, but in animating his chimeric Creature (Jacob Elordi), he sows the seeds of his own demise. But del Toro's vision, awash with absolutely sumptuous set and costume design, and bolstered by a phenomenal expanded cast (notably Charles Dance as Victor's cruel father and Mia Goth in a dual role that adds a twisted perspective to Victor's motivations) brings the story to life like never before. It's instantly among del Toro's best works.\n\nThe Twits\n\nPlenty of married couples bicker, but Mrs. Twit (Margo Martindale) and Mr. Twit (British comedian Johnny Vegas) hate each other. They only seem to stay together to bring their twisted theme park Twitlandia to life. But when their efforts go disastrously awry, it's left to orphans Beesha (Maitreyi Ramakrishnan) and Bubsy (Ryan Lopez) and the mystical Muggle-Wumps to take down the wicked pair. Director Phil Johnston's (Ralph Breaks the Internet) take on Roald Dahl's dark children's tale is a world away from the original (and wisely jettisons some of the problematic elements of the source material), but despite keeping plenty of crass humor, it becomes surprisingly—if not subtly—political amidst the gross-out gags. One for younger viewers, but with enough wit to entertain older ones too.\n\nThe Blackening\n\nWhen a group of Black college friends hold a reunion for Juneteenth, the vibe seems off. For starters, they’re meeting at a cabin in the woods, which is a little too close to horror movie territory. Such genre-savviness begins to pay off when they discover a suspicious board game in the basement and find themselves playing by a serial killer’s twisted rules—starting with determining the “Blackest” member of the group to sacrifice. With a cast of comedy greats including X Mayo, Jermaine Fowler, and Jay Pharoah, The Blackening is a self-aware and smartly satirical twist on horror movie conventions that brilliantly plays on its tongue-in-cheek tagline: “We can’t all die first.” Packing in just the right level of scares to avoid going full parody, this is perfect Halloween viewing.\n\nThe Running Man\n\nIn an America that has become a totalitarian police state, the corrupt government maintains power through propaganda and control of communication, making those it deems criminals fight for their freedom in a lethal game show that has replaced true justice. That’s in the dystopian “future” of 2017 though, where Ben Richards (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is the latest victim of the system, forced to compete after being framed for a series of murders. Released in 1987, The Running Man finds Arnie at his cheesiest, delivering one-liners while killing outlandish goons with panache. While it loses a lot of the satire and cultural warnings of the original Stephen King novel, this action classic remains an entertaining watch, and well worth a look ahead of the upcoming remake, directed by Edgar Wright, which looks set to stick closer to the source material.\n\nMantis\n\nSet in the same universe as Kill Bok-soon, this Korean action extravaganza shifts focus to contract killer Lee Han-ul (Yim Si-wan), better known as Mantis, who returns from a vacation—even assassins need a break—to find the violent world in which he operates in chaos. The shadowy organization MK ENT has fallen, leaving no one to enforce the honor rules that once governed the profession, but more importantly, creating a power vacuum to be filled. As Mantis aims to take control and restore order, his complicated relationship with ally/rival(/love interest?) Shin Jae-yi (Park Gyu-young) threatens to make everything a thousand times worse. While it takes a lighter tone than Kill Bok-soon, leaning more on comedy than action, Mantis serves up phenomenal fight choreography and sizzling chemistry between its leads, making for a solid spinoff.\n\nDevo\n\nListen up, you spuds—Devo were more than a bunch of kooks wearing energy dome hats. The accidentally iconic band were pioneers of New Wave music, practically invented the concept of the music video, and did it all while sending polite society into a panic. Directed by master documentarian Chris Smith, this insightful film charts the rise of the band, from their formation in the wake of the Kent State shootings of 1970 through to becoming one of the most overtly political rock groups in history—even as their commentary on the devolution of mass culture was often lost on their listeners.\n\nThe Thursday Murder Club\n\nIn the picturesque retirement community of Coopers Chase, the Thursday Murder Club—former union leader Ron (Pierce Brosnan), psychiatrist Ibrahim (Ben Kingsley), nurse Joyce (Celia Imrie) and de facto leader Elizabeth (Helen Mirren), a retired MI6 officer—meets each week to share their theories on cold cases. It’s all grim fun and games until one of Coopers Chase’s owners is murdered on their doorstep—right after opposing plans to redevelop the community as part of a luxury property deal. But as the club puts their not-so-amateur sleuthing skills to the test, they all emerge as suspects. Based on the series of novels by Richard Osman, and with a killer cast of British and Irish acting royalty, this is a cozy crime caper to die for.\n\nMononoke The Movie II: The Ashes of Rage\n\nSet a month after the events of The Phantom in the Rain, the second in a planned trilogy finds the mysterious Medicine Seller returning to the Inner Chambers of the Imperial Palace in Edo-era Japan. While conditions for the emperor’s lower-ranking concubines have improved, prickly political machinations make things more dangerous than ever for the upper tier, including warring favorites Fuki and Botan—and that’s before a new supernatural terror raises its head. Another masterclass in tension and otherworldly horror, Mononoke maintains its stunning visual approach evoking watercolors on parchment, making for one of the most sumptuous and visually striking pieces of animation you’ll ever see.\n\nZiam\n\nThere’s a lot to recommend about Ziam, but the elevator pitch is just four words: Muay Thai versus zombies. The literal translation of the Thai title gives us four more: “Biting Mouth, Kicking Feet.” If that doesn’t make you want to watch this action-horror outing, seek help. Set in an already dystopian future where the climate crisis has melted the ice caps, former professional fighter Singh (Prin Suparat) is desperate to reunite with his girlfriend Rin (Nuttanicha Dungwattanawanich), a doctor in his hometown of Chiang Dao. Cue one zombie outbreak courtesy of the shady VS Corporation, and soon Singh is punching, kicking, and elbowing his way through hordes of ravenous undead, trying to evacuate Rin and a young patient from her hospital—before it’s blown up to contain the infection! Think Ong Bak meets Dawn of the Dead meets The Raid, and throw in some of the most horrifying zombie designs in years, and Ziam makes for a schlocky but thrilling time.\n\nKPop Demon Hunters\n\nThree-part harmony group Huntr/x are at the top of their game. Not only are they the world's best-loved girl group, but in their secret side role as Earth's defenders against demonic forces, they're about to permanently seal away an ancient evil. Unfortunately, lead singer Rumi (Arden Cho) is hiding something from bandmates Mira (May Hong) and Zoey (Ji-young Yoo), and her dark secret may tear them apart right as they face their strongest foes—an evil boyband fronted by the devilishly handsome Jinu (Ahn Hyo-seop). Blending the pastel-pop of Jem and the Holograms, the monster-slaying action of Buffy, and enough K-pop earworms to make Blackpink blink, Kpop Demon Hunters is a perfect summer movie for kids and families, a brilliantly animated adventure that's as fresh and memorable as its energetic musical numbers.\n\nOur Times\n\nIn 1966, husband and wife physicists Nora (Lucero) and Héctor (Benny Ibarra) are equal partners at the University of Mexico, even though their colleagues see Nora as little more than Héctor's lab assistant. Then they crack the secret of time travel, catapulting themselves forward to 2025—and strand themselves here. While both marvel at the leaps humanity has made in half a century, Nora is delighted to be reunited with her former protégé Julia (Ofelia Medina), now dean of the university. But as Héctor finds himself desperate to return to the comfort and prestige he enjoyed in the past, the pair's relationship begins to fall apart. More rom-com than sci-fi, this is time-travel with a bittersweet touch.\n\nLost in Starlight\n\nDr. Nan-young Joo is desperate to follow in her late astronaut mother's footsteps and make it all the way to Mars. Jay is a slacker part-timer, loosely aspiring to be a musician. In this Korean animated movie from director Han Ji-won, they become a pair of literally star-crossed lovers, linked by a love of music. While the sci-fi aspect of it all makes for some spectacular visuals, from the futuristic-but-plausible view of Seoul in 2051, to truly cosmic, almost psychedelic, sequences as Nan-young ventures into space, the story's heart lies in the quieter, meaningful moments between its leads. Absolutely exquisite.\n\nKill Boksoon\n\nTo her friends, Gil Bok-soon (Jeon Do-yeon) is a successful events executive and dedicated single mother to her daughter Jae-yeong (Kim Si-a). In reality, she's the star performer at MK Ent—an assassination bureau, where her almost superhuman ability to predict every step in a critical situation has earned her a 100 percent success rate and a legendary reputation. The only problem: She's considering retiring at the end of her contract, a decision that opens her to threats from disgruntled enemies and ambitious colleagues alike. While its title and premise not-so-subtly evokes Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill, director Byun Sung-hyun takes this Korean action epic to giddy heights with some of the most impressive fights committed to screen since, well, Kill Bill.\n\nBullet Train Explosion\n\nKazuya Takaichi (Tsuyoshi Kusanagi) is conductor of the Hayabusa 60 shinkansen, zooming from Shin-Aomori to Tokyo. A perfectly normal job—until a terrorist reveals a bomb onboard, which will explode if the train slows below 100 kmph. As authorities race to stop the attacker and rescue the passengers, Kazuya is forced to keep everyone onboard safe. What's that? It's just Speed on a Japanese train? Nah, Speed was just the original 1975 The Bullet Train on an American bus—and this modern-day version is equal parts remake and sequel to that Sonny Chiba-starring classic. It's more than an entertaining action thriller, though—director Shinji Higuchi relishes the opportunity to poke fun at point-scoring politicians crippled by bureaucratic process in responding to the crisis (no surprise to anyone who's seen 2016's Shin Godzilla, which he codirected with Hideaki Anno). High-speed, literally explosive action, with a satirical edge, Bullet Train Explosion is a blast (sorry).\n\nThe Imaginary\n\nThis gorgeously animated take on the concept of imaginary friends is a whimsical fable full of stunning visuals and big ideas. Adapted from the book by A. F. Harrold, The Imaginary follows young Amanda and her best friend Rudger—brought into being by her own mind—as they share countless adventures. But as Amanda ages, Rudger faces the fate of all Imaginaries: fading away as their humans forget them. The latest film from director Yoshiyuki Momose (Mary and the Witch’s Flower) and Studio Ponoc—spiritual successor to the mighty Studio Ghibli—this is a stunning ode to the power of imagination and friendship.\n\nDead Talents Society\n\nWhen keeping the living terrified is the economy of the afterlife, death becomes a literal capitalist hellhole. Dead Talents Society sees warring \"ghostresses\" Catherine (Sandrine Pinna) and her former protégé Jessica (Eleven Yao) battling for glamour and prestige in the great beyond by innovating new ways of scaring mortals, while a newcomer known only as Rookie (Gingle Wang) struggles to make her mark with any scares at all—and risks fading away entirely if she can't earn her undead keep. A sharply satirical horror comedy poking fun at everything from reality TV to hustle culture, this Taiwanese outing from writer-director John Hsu beats Beetlejuice at its own game.\n\nLeave the World Behind\n\nA weekend getaway at a luxury vacation rental property for Amanda and Clay and their kids, Archie and Rose, takes a sinister turn in the wake of an inexplicable blackout. When the house's owner, George, and his daughter Ruth return early, suspicions mount—but a growing herd of deer lurking outside the house, failing vehicles, and scattered reports of attacks across the US force the two families to rely on each other in the face of what may be the end of the world. Adapted from the novel of same name by Rumaan Alam, and with a star-studded cast including Julia Roberts, Mahershala Ali, Ethan Hawke, Myha'la, and Kevin Bacon, this relishes in keeping the audiences as uncertain as its characters, explaining little, and leaving questions you'll be mulling for days.\n\nTroll\n\nThis gleefully entertaining giant monster movie abandons tearing up Tokyo or New York in favor of director Roar Uthaug’s (2018's Tomb Raider) native Norway, with a titanic troll stomping its way toward Oslo after being roused by a drilling operation. Although the plot and characters will be familiar to any fan of kaiju cinema, the striking Nordic visuals and the titular menace’s ability to blend in with the landscape, allows for some impressively original twists along the way. Although Troll could have easily descended into near-parody, Uthaug steers clear of smug self-awareness and instead delivers, and with a sequel arriving later in 2025, now is the perfect time to revisit one of the freshest takes on the genre in years.\n\nY Tu Mamá También\n\nIt's uncommon to find much in the way of classic films on Netflix—the algorithm must ever be fed by the churn of the new—so the availability of Alfonso Cuarón's brilliant 2001 coming-of-age movie is a real delight. Set in Mexico in 1999, Y Tu Mamá También (“And your mother, too”) follows rich kid Tenoch (Diego Luna) and his working-class friend Julio (Gael García Bernal) on a road trip with Luisa (Maribel Verdú), the wife of Tenoch’s cousin. It's a journey that sees the young men—still boys, really—competing for attention from the beautiful older woman, trapping themselves in lies and trying to get by on unearned confidence, all while claiming to be heading to a picture-perfect beach that they made up. As for why the much more mature and experienced Luisa would go along with them in the first place? Pack tissues. While the film courted controversy for its frank depiction of sex and drugs (it's not one for family film night), it remains a masterpiece; a raucous and all-too-real examination of young friendships and fragile masculinity.\n\nParasite\n\nDirector Bong Joon-ho's searing 2019 thriller is the first non-English film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, and it's abundantly clear why. Its bleak exploration of economic disparity and condemnation of capitalistic excess is focused on its South Korea setting, but it resonates with global audiences. Parasite follows the struggling Kim family as they each infiltrate the lives of the wealthy Parks, posing as household servants to live a life of proximate luxury before their deception spirals wildly out of control. Somehow, it's also darkly comedic, mocking the obliviousness of the rich classes, both to their own privileges and to the desperation of the poor. Throughout, it's exquisitely shot and expertly paced, with Bong deftly increasing the tension with every scene until everything approaches a seemingly inevitable conclusion—and then still manages to twist and subvert audience expectations. A spectacular piece of filmmaking that deserves the hype, this examination of class and inequality feels more relevant than ever.\n\nCarry-On\n\nIs a movie set at Christmas in itself a Christmas movie? That debate has surged around Die Hard for decades. Now Carry-On asks the same question. A zippy thriller from House of Wax and Black Adam director Jaume Collet-Serra, this sees TSA agent Ethan Kopek (Taron Egerton) caught in the Christmas Eve shift from hell when he’s blackmailed by a mercenary known only as the Traveler (Jason Bateman) into allowing a deadly package through security. Cue a lethal game of cat-and-mouse as Ethan tries to stop the Traveler—all with the life of Ethan’s girlfriend Nora (Sofia Carson) in the balance. It’s pulpy and schlocky in places, but this throwback action outing can’t help but entertain.\n\nJoy\n\nIn vitro fertilization may seem like a relatively mundane medical procedure nowadays, one that's brought hope and family to countless people struggling to conceive, but when the procedure was developed by a trio of British scientists and medics in the 1960s and '70s, it was hugely controversial. That makes for powerful material for this dramatization, charting the work of nurse and embryologist Jean Purdy (Thomasin McKenzie), scientist Robert Edwards (James Norton), and surgeon Patrick Steptoe (Bill Nighy), even as they're demonized by the public, the UK government, and even—perhaps especially—the church. McKenzie in particular is brilliant as Purdy, torn by her own conflict of faith at being involved in the life-changing work, which also involved providing safe abortion care to women who needed it, and struggling to deal with the ostracizing she faces from her family and community as a result. A powerful and provocative drama, even now.\n\nWoman of the Hour\n\nA serial killer is cast as a bachelor on a dating game show, allowing him to size up his next potential victim right in front of the audience watching at home. That'd be a twisted setup for a slasher flick—but what's horrifying about Woman of the Hour is that it's based on the real-life case of Rodney Alcala, who was a contestant on The Dating Game in 1978 while in the midst of a string of murders. This dramatization isn't centered on the killer, though. In her directorial debut, Anna Kendrick focuses instead on Sheryl (played by Kendrick, based on the real life Cheryl Bradshaw), the one unfortunate enough to be matched with Alcala (Daniel Zovatto), and the women who reported or suspected the killer, only to be routinely ignored by authorities. A taut thriller that makes clear the real horror lies in how easily Acala eluded attention for so long.\n\nWill & Harper\n\nWill Ferrell likely needs no introduction, but as former head writer of Saturday Night Live, Harper Steele is more accustomed to life behind the camera. Joining the hit show in the same week back in 1995, the pair struck up a decades-long friendship—so when Harper wrote to tell Ferrell she was transitioning to live as a woman, it was a big change for them both. It also formed the basis for this beautiful, heartwarming, and often laugh-out-loud funny road trip documentary following the duo as they cross the US in an old Jeep Grand Wagoneer, reconnecting and learning what their friendship looks like now. It's awkward viewing at times—some of Ferrell's questions blur the line between bawdy and simply rude—but it's a raw and authentic journey for them both. Beyond the personal touches, Will & Harper is a timely view of what America looks like for a trans person right now, making it possibly one of the most important documentaries Netflix has produced.\n\nHis Three Daughters\n\nAs their father approaches the end of his life, sisters Rachel (Natasha Lyonne), Katie (Carrie Coon), and Christina (Elizabeth Olsen) are forced to reconnect while waiting for the inevitable. Bleak stuff, but also grounds for masterful performances from the lead trio, with Rachel having taken on the bulk of care for months, Katie casting imperious demands despite avoiding the situation, and new-agey Christina trying to keep the peace—despite being at a breaking point herself. This is almost a locked-room piece, the apartment trapping the women, forcing them to come to terms with not only their father's death but their own relationships with each other, all while Vincent (Jay O. Sanders) haunts them even before his passing. Death may loom over director Azazel Jacobs’ drama, but His Three Daughters ultimately proves oddly life-affirming.\n\nGrave of the Fireflies\n\nWhen Seita and his young sister Setsuko are orphaned in the wake of the fire-bombing of Kobe during the final days of World War II, the siblings are forced into terrible circumstances to survive. Stuck between abusive extended family and the sheer desperation of scavenging around the ruins of their destroyed hometown, it's a bleak existence—and also the basis for one of Studio Ghibli's finest works. Directed by Isao Takahata and based on a short story by Akiyuki Nosaka, Grave of the Fireflies is unapologetically harrowing in its exploration of how war and nationalism chew up the most vulnerable, yet peppered with moments of unwavering love as Seita attempts to protect Setsuko's innocence. This searing wartime drama is sobering but essential viewing, a film that's more than earned its ranking in the upper echelons of the Best Studio Ghibli films.\n\nRebel Ridge\n\nWhen corrupt cops run ex-Marine Terry Richmond (Aaron Pierre) off the road for cycling while Black, they also seize the money he had been planning to use to post his cousin’s bail. Despite the injustice, Terry tries to do everything by the book but finds almost every aspect of the legal system against him. Out of patience, and fueled by immensely justified anger, he sets about tearing out the rot from the small town, aided only by court clerk Summer (AnnaSophia Robb). Writer-director Jeremy Saulnier could have made Rebel Ridge merely a modern day First Blood, but while there’s plenty of visceral, bone-breaking fight scenes, it’s the film’s righteously angry look at the baked-in failings of the American legal system that gives this its bite—all while cementing Pierre as an action star to watch.\n\nUnder Paris\n\nThis so-serious-it's-ludicrous French creature feature sees Bérénice Bejo as marine specialist Sophia Assalas, who is hunting down a mako shark that has not only spontaneously mutated to survive in the freshwater Seine but is also about to give birth to a host of baby man-eating sharks. Worse still? Paris is about to hold a triathlon, with the swim portion set to become an all-you-can-eat buffet! Look, not everything on this list needs to be high art—sometimes, you just need to see a mutant shark straight up chomping on people while increasingly desperate humans start blowing stuff up. Press Play, turn brain off, enjoy.\n\nGodzilla Minus One\n\nDespite the presence of the eponymous kaiju, Godzilla Minus One is a film rooted in the humanity of its protagonists, deserter kamikaze pilot Koichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) and Noriko Ōishi (Minami Hamabe), a survivor of the bombings of Tokyo. Thrown together as an ersatz family as they raise an orphaned baby, their attempts to build a new life turn chaotic when the irradiated reptile descends on the city just as it's beginning to recover. Director Takashi Yamazaki's reimagining of Japan's premier kaiju netted the King of Monsters its first-ever Oscar, picking up a statue for Best Visual Effects at the 2024 Academy Awards, but this is a film that exceeds mere spectacle—it's a searing examination of life after war, and how a nation grapples with being on the losing side.\n\nSuzume\n\nSuzume Iwato (voiced by Nanoka Hara in Japanese, Nichole Sakura in English) lives with her aunt on Japan's southern island, having lost her mother in the Tōhoku earthquake of 2011. When a handsome young stranger named Souta (Hokuto Matsumura, Josh Keaton) asks her for directions to some local ruins, she follows him out of curiosity but disturbs a living keystone, accidentally unleashing an ancient power that threatens to destroy the entire country. Drawn into Souta's world, the pair chase the keystone, now in the form of a cat, across Japan in a desperate bid to reseal the destructive entity—a quest that would be easier if Souta hadn't been transformed into a child's wooden chair. The latest film from Makoto Shinkai (Your Name, Weathering with You), Suzume is a breathtakingly animated slice of magical realism with a surrealist edge—but beyond the spectacle, it's a heart-warming tale of community and humanity, each stop on the unlikely pair's journey a snapshot of people and families coming together in the wake of tragedy.\n\nRustin\n\nDirected by George C. Wolfe (Ma Rainey's Black Bottom), this biopic explores the life of civil rights activist Bayard Rustin. While perhaps best known as one of the chief organizers of 1963's March on Washington, Rustin was also openly, unapologetically gay at a time when that was phenomenally rare—and the film doesn't shy away from how that alienated many of the people he worked with, his sexuality often seen as a threat to the movement. A much-needed spotlight on an overlooked but pivotal figure in the Civil Rights Movement, elevated by a central performance from a spectacularly well-cast Colman Domingo as Rustin himself.\n\nHis House\n\nFleeing war-torn South Sudan, Bol (Ṣọpẹ́ Dìrísù) and Rial (Wunmi Mosaku) are now living in a run-down house at the edge of London, harassed by their neighbors even as they try to fit in. The couple are also haunted by the lives they left behind—both figuratively and (possibly) literally, with visions of their late daughter Nyagak, who did not survive the journey, fading in and out of the walls of their dismal new home. The real horror of His House isn't the strange visions, haunted house, or potential ghosts, though—it’s the bleakness of the lives Bol and Rial are forced into, the hostility and dehumanization of the UK asylum process, the racism both overt and casual, all coupled with the enormous sense of loss they carry with them. Blending the macabre with the mundane, director Remi Weekes delivers a tense, challenging film that will haunt viewers as much as its characters.\n\nEldorado: Everything the Nazis Hate\n\nCentered on the eponymous Berlin nightclub, this documentary explores the lives of LGBTQ+ people during the interwar years, from the roaring 1920s through the rise of the Nazis and into the horrors of World War II. With a blend of archival footage, recreations, and first-person accounts, director Benjamin Cantu paints a picture of gleeful decadence, the Eldorado as an almost hallowed ground where performers and patrons alike experimented with gender expression and were free to openly display their sexuality. It's an ode to what was lost, but with an eye on the bizarre contradictions of the age, where openly gay club-goers would wear their own Nazi uniforms as the years went by. Everything the Nazis Hate is emotionally challenging viewing in places, but it serves up an important slice of queer history that many will be completely unaware of.\n\nThey Cloned Tyrone\n\nDrug dealer Fontaine (John Boyega) got shot to death last night. So why has he just woken up in bed as if nothing happened? That existential question leads Fontaine and two unlikely allies—prostitute Yo-Yo (Teyonah Parris) and pimp Slick Charles (Jamie Foxx)—to uncovering a vast conspiracy centered on a Black-majority town called The Glen, where people are kept mollified by hypnotic rap music, dumbed down with drug-laced fried chicken and grape juice, and preached into obedience at church. But who’s using the town as a petri dish, and why is there a cloning lab buried underground? This lethally sharp satire from writer and debut director Juel Taylor masterfully blends genres, from the use of visual motifs and dated clichés from 1970s Blaxploitation cinema to its frequent steps into sci-fi territory and laugh-out-loud comedy. But it’s the powerhouse performances from its central cast that mark this as one to watch.\n\nNimona\n\nShapeshifter Nimona can become anything she wants, a gift that causes people to fear and shun her. If society is going to treat her like a villain, she's going to be one, so she decides to become the sidekick of the hated black knight, Ballister Blackheart. Unfortunately for the aspiring menace, Blackheart isn't quite the monster he's made out to be, and he instead tries to rein in Nimona's more murderous tendencies as he seeks to clear his name of a crime he didn't commit—and face down his old friend Ambrosius Goldenloin in the process. Adapted from N. D. Stevenson's groundbreaking graphic novel, Nimona is more than just another fanciful fantasy—it's a tale of outsiders and exiles, people trying to do right even when their community rejects them, and the joy of finding their own little band along the way. After an almost decade-long journey to the screen, this dazzlingly animated movie has become an instant classic.\n\nCargo\n\nIn a world already ravaged by a zombie-like plague, Andy Rose (Martin Freeman) only wants to keep his family safe, sticking to Australia’s rural back roads to avoid infection. After his wife is tragically bitten, and infects him in turn, Andy is desperate to find a safe haven for his infant daughter, Rosie. With a mere 48 hours until he succumbs himself, Andy finds an ally in Thoomi (Simone Landers), an Aboriginal girl looking to protect her own rabid father. But with threats from paranoid survivalists and Aboriginal communities hunting the infected, it may already be too late. A unique twist on the zombie apocalypse, Cargo abandons the familiar urban landscapes of the genre for the breathtaking wilds of Australia and offers a slower, character-led approach to the end of the world.\n\nCall Me Chihiro\n\nAn idyllic slice-of-life movie with a twist, Call Me Chihiro follows a former sex worker—the eponymous Chihiro, played by Kasumi Arimura—after she moves to a seaside town to work in a bento restaurant. This isn’t a tale of a woman on the run or trying to escape her past—Chihiro is refreshingly forthright and unapologetic, and her warmth and openness soon begin to change the lives of her neighbors. Directed by Rikiya Imaizumi, this is an intimate, heartfelt character drama that alternates between moments of aching loneliness and sheer joy, packed with emotional beats that remind viewers of the importance of even the smallest connections.\n\nGlass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery\n\nDaniel Craig reprises his role as detective Benoit Blanc in this brilliant follow-up to 2019’s phenomenal whodunnit, Knives Out. Writer-director Rian Johnson crafts a fiendishly sharp new case for “the Last of the Gentlemen Sleuths,” taking Blanc to a Greek island getaway for a reclusive tech billionaire and his collection of friends and hangers-on, where a planned murder mystery weekend takes a deadly turn. While totally accessible for newcomers, fans of the first film will also be rewarded with some deeper character development for Blanc, a role that’s shaping up to be as iconic for Craig as 007. As cleverly written and meticulously constructed as its predecessor, and featuring the kind of all-star cast—Edward Norton! Janelle Monáe! Kathryn Hahn! Leslie Odom Jr.! Jessica Henwick! Madelyn Cline! Kate Hudson! Dave Bautista!—that cinema dreams are made of, Glass Onion might be the best thing Netflix has dropped all year.\n\nThe Wonder\n\nFlorence Pugh dazzles in this not-quite-horror film from Oscar-winning director Sebastián Lelio. Set in 1862, English nurse Lib Wright (Pugh) is sent to Ireland to observe Anna O’Donnell, a girl who claims to have not eaten in four months, subsisting instead on “manna from heaven.” Still grieving the loss of her own child, Lib is torn between investigating the medical impossibility and growing concern for Anna herself. Amid obstacles in the form of Anna’s deeply religious family and a local community that distrusts her, Lib’s watch descends into a tense, terrifying experience. Based on a book of the same name by Emma Donoghue, The Wonder is a beautiful yet bleakly shot period piece that explores the all-too-mortal horrors that unquestioning religious fervor and family secrets can wreak.\n\nRRR\n\nOne of India’s biggest films of all time, RRR (or Rise, Roar, Revolt) redefines the notion of cinematic spectacle. Set in 1920, the historical epic follows real-life Indian revolutionaries Alluri Sitrama Raju (Ram Charan) and Komaram Bheem (N. T. Rama Rao Jr.) but fictionalizes their lives and actions. Although they come from very different walks of life, their similarities draw them together as they face down sadistic governor Scott Buxton (Ray Stevenson) and his cruel wife, Catherine (Alison Doody). No mere period fluff, RRR is a bold, exciting, and often explosive piece of filmmaking that elevates its heroes to near-mythological status. Director S. S. Rajamouli deploys brilliantly shot action scenes—and an exquisitely choreographed dance number—that grab viewers’ attention and refuse to let go. Whether you’re a longtime fan of Indian cinema or just looking for an action flick beyond the Hollywood norm, RRR is not to be missed.\n\nI Lost My Body\n\nAn award winner at Cannes in 2019, this tale of burgeoning young love, obsession, and autonomous body parts is every bit as weird as you might expect for a French adult animated film. Director Jérémy Clapin charts the life of Naoufel, a Moroccan immigrant in modern-day France who falls for the distant Gabrielle, and Naoufel’s severed hand, which makes its way across the city to try to reconnect. With intersecting timelines and complex discussions about fate, I Lost My Body is often mind-bending yet always captivating, and Clapin employs brilliantly detailed animation and phenomenal color choices throughout. Worth watching in both the original French and the solid English dub featuring Dev Patel and Alia Shawkat, this one dares you to make sense of it all.\n\nDon’t Look Up\n\nFrustrated by the world’s collective inaction on existential threats like climate change? Maybe don’t watch Don’t Look Up, director Adam McKay’s satirical black comedy. When two low-level astronomers discover a planet-killing comet on a collision course with Earth, they try to warn the authorities—only to be met with a collective “meh.” Matters only get worse when they attempt to leak the news themselves and have to navigate vapid TV hosts, celebrities looking for a signature cause, and an indifferent public. A bleakly funny indictment of our times, bolstered by a star-studded cast fronted by Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence, Don’t Look Up is, somewhat depressingly, one of the best portraits of humanity since Idiocracy.",

    "text": "The only smartphone manufacturer with a 10/10 iFixit repairability score is finally bringing its products to the US, but it isn't starting with its phones. Netherlands-based Fairphone announced this week that it will mark its expansion into the US with the Fairbuds XL, its repairable over-ear headphones. It'll be available on Amazon later this month.\n\nFairphone says it achieved 61 percent revenue growth in the third quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, though this is likely attributed to the launch of The Fairphone (Gen 6)—the company doesn't release a new phone every year. It sold more than 100,000 units in 2024, including phones and audio products.\n\nRight-to-repair laws have been cropping up all over the US, and Fairphone smartphones are the easiest to repair. The company provides a screwdriver, sells spare parts for years, and offers long-term software support. Its devices may not be the flashiest or the most powerful, but they are a more sustainable solution, also ensuring fair mining practices and wages for workers in its supply chain.\n\nBringing its smartphone over to the US is a little more complicated than headphones, as it requires carrier certifications, but Fairphone tells WIRED it's in “advanced discussions” with select retailers and carriers.\n\nWhatsApp Arrives on the Apple Watch\n\nCourtesy of Meta\n\nMeta seems to be on a quest to finally bring its apps to other platforms. A few months ago, it launched an Instagram app for the iPad; now we're getting WhatsApp on the Apple Watch. Rather than just mirroring your notifications and sending basic replies, now you can read full messages on the Apple Watch, record and send voice messages, see who's calling, send emoji reactions to messages, and see more of the chat history on the screen.\n\nIt syncs with your iPhone, so you don't need to set it up as a companion device. You can't take calls on the watch itself or even answer them; you can see who is calling and decline. It also doesn't seem as though you can add the WhatsApp app as a complication.\n\nMotorola’s Cheapest Phone Now Has 5G\n\nIt's a little earlier than usual, but Motorola's latest budget phones are here: the Moto G 2026 and Moto G Play 2026. They share a similar look and aren't too different from the design language Motorola has employed on its 2025 Moto G devices. What's most notable is that the Moto G Play will have 5G support, making it one of the cheapest handsets with 5G at $170.\n\nBoth phones have 6.7-inch 120-Hz LCD screens, big 5,200-mAh batteries, and IP52 water resistance. They're powered by MediaTek's Dimensity 6300 processor with 4 GB of RAM, but they differ in storage size, with the Moto G offering 128 GB of internal storage and the Play with 64 GB (both are expandable with a microSD). Cameras are the other place where the two phones diverge, with a 50-MP main sensor on the Moto G and a 32-MP sensor on the Play. Yes, they still have headphone jacks.\n\nMotorola says the Moto G Play will arrive first on November 13 at Motorola, Best Buy, and Amazon for $170, and the $200 Moto G launches on December 11 at Motorola's website first, then at Best Buy and Amazon on January 15.\n\nCanon’s R6 III Goes More Pro\n\nCourtesy of Canon\n\nCanon has announced its much-anticipated new EOS R6 Mark III full-frame mirrorless camera. The R6 III features a new 32.5-megapixel sensor (the same sensor in the EOS C50 cinema camera), as well as the company's latest Digic X processor.",

    "text": "During an earnings call on Monday, Rocket Lab chief executive Pete Beck announced that the company’s medium-lift launch vehicle, Neutron, would not launch this year.\n\nFor anyone with the slightest understanding of the challenges involved in bringing a new rocket to the launch pad, as well as a calendar, the delay does not come as a surprise. Although Rocket Lab had been holding on to the possibility of launching Neutron this year publicly, it has been clear for months that a slip into 2026 was inevitable.\n\nAccording to Beck, speaking during a third-quarter 2025 earnings call, the new timeline has the company bringing Neutron to Launch Complex 2 at Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia during the first quarter of next year. The first launch is scheduled to occur “thereafter,” according to the company’s plans.\n\nThe Rocket Lab way\n\nAs part of his remarks, Beck said Rocket Lab would not be rushed by an arbitrary deadline.\n\n“We’ve seen what happens when others rush to the pad with an unproven product, and we just refused to do that,” he said, referring to other commercial launch companies that have not had success with their first launches. “Our aim is to make it to orbit on the first try. You won’t see us using some qualifier about us just clearing the pad, and claiming success and whatnot, and that means that we don’t want to learn something during Neutron’s first flight that could be learned on the ground during the testing phase.”\n\nThrough the development of the smaller Electron rocket as well as various satellites and in-space vehicles, Rocket Lab has followed and honed a process that breeds success in flight, Beck said. Right now, Rocket Lab is in a “meaty” testing process when components of the vehicle are being assembled for the first time, Beck added.\n\nCredit: Rocket Lab Rocket Lab has reached the “meaty” part of the testing process. Rocket Lab has reached the “meaty” part of the testing process. Credit: Rocket Lab\n\n“This is a time when you find out on the ground what you got right, and what you got wrong, rather than finding out that during first launch,” he said. “Now at Rocket Lab, we have a proven process for delivering and developing complex space flight hardware, and I think that process speaks for itself with respect to our hardware, always looking beautiful, and, more importantly, always working beautifully. Now, our process is meticulous, but it works.”",

Lanteris is the latest addition to a line of corporate brands that dates back to 1957. Until last month, the company was known as Maxar Space Systems. Its acquisition by Intuitive Machines would be perhaps the industry’s most evident example of a “New Space” firm buying up an “Old Space” company.\n\nThe deal would help Intuitive Machines expand beyond its core competency of Moon missions to the broader sector of satellite manufacturing and space services. Lanteris has been owned since 2023 by Advent International, a private equity firm. The transaction is expected to close early next year, subject to “customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions,” according to Intuitive Machines.\n\nImportantly, the acquisition of Lanteris will shore up Intuitive Machines’ balance sheet. Intuitive Machines reported $228 million in revenue last year. With Lanteris in the fold, the company predicts its revenue will grow to $850 million, enough to become profitable.\n\n“As a standalone company, Lanteris is a cash generating business,” Intuitive Machines said in a press release. “As a combined company, Intuitive Machines expects to have adequate cash on hand for continued operations.”\n\nHouston-based Intuitive Machines was founded in 2013 by businessman Kam Ghaffarian and veteran NASA engineers Stephen Altemus and Tim Crain. The company, now traded on the public market, is best known for building commercial robotic lunar landers. Its first two Moon missions, developed under contract to NASA, reached the lunar surface in February 2024 and in March of this year. The IM-1 and IM-2 landers tipped over after touchdown, prompting engineers to make design changes before the company’s next lunar mission in 2026.",

    "text": "When engineers build AI language models like GPT-5 from training data, at least two major processing features emerge: memorization (reciting exact text they’ve seen before, like famous quotes or passages from books) and reasoning (solving new problems using general principles). New research from AI startup Goodfire.ai provides the first potentially clear evidence that these different functions actually work through completely separate neural pathways in the model’s architecture.\n\nThe researchers discovered that this separation proves remarkably clean. In a preprint paper released in late October, they described that when they removed the memorization pathways, models lost 97 percent of their ability to recite training data verbatim but kept nearly all their “logical reasoning” ability intact.\n\nFor example, at layer 22 in Allen Institute for AI’s OLMo-7B language model, the bottom 50 percent of weight components showed 23 percent higher activation on memorized data, while the top 10 percent showed 26 percent higher activation on general, non-memorized text. This mechanistic split enabled the researchers to surgically remove memorization while preserving other capabilities.\n\nPerhaps most surprisingly, the researchers found that arithmetic operations seem to share the same neural pathways as memorization rather than logical reasoning. When they removed memorization circuits, mathematical performance plummeted to 66 percent while logical tasks remained nearly untouched. This discovery may explain why AI language models notoriously struggle with math without the use of external tools. They’re attempting to recall arithmetic from a limited memorization table rather than computing it, like a student who memorized times tables but never learned how multiplication works. The finding suggests that at current scales, language models treat “2+2=4” more like a memorized fact than a logical operation.\n\nIt’s worth noting that “reasoning” in AI research covers a spectrum of abilities that don’t necessarily match what we might call reasoning in humans. The logical reasoning that survived memory removal in this latest research includes tasks like evaluating true/false statements and following if-then rules, which are essentially applying learned patterns to new inputs. This also differs from the deeper “mathematical reasoning” required for proofs or novel problem-solving, which current AI models struggle with even when their pattern-matching abilities remain intact.",

    "text": "Canada has lost its measles elimination status, meaning the highly infectious virus is considered endemic once again in the country, The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) announced Monday.\n\nThe determination was made by a committee of PAHO experts, who spent last week poring over disease data to assess the measles status of countries across the entire region. The fact that Canada has lost its elimination status means that the region of the Americas overall has also lost the status, which it achieved in 2016. Of the 35 countries and territories in the region—a health region designated by the World Health Organization—Canada is currently the only country where measles is considered to be spreading endemically, though other countries, namely the US and Mexico, are headed in the same direction.\n\nMeasles is considered eliminated when a country can go 12 months without continuous local spread. Sporadic cases brought in from international travel can continue to occur, potentially causing limited outbreaks. But elimination is lost and endemicity is declared only when transmission is sustained over the course of a year.\n\nCanada achieved elimination in 1998. The US did the same in 2000. Elimination was achieved through hard-fought vaccination campaigns, as two doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is 97 percent protective against the virus, and that protection is considered lifelong. But, since that time, vaccine misinformation and potent rhetoric from anti-vaccine activists—including current US Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—have taken hold, driving vaccination rates down on a population level. While the vast majority of American and Canadian parents continue to vaccinate their children, certain pockets and close-knit communities have become dramatically undervaccinated, providing potential footholds for the virus.\n\nThat is the case in Canada, where a massive outbreak began in October 2024. It started in Canada’s province of New Brunswick, and cases linked to the outbreak have since been detected across the country. As of November 1, the Government of Canada has tallied 5,162 measles cases since the start of the year. In the PAHO meeting last week, experts evaluated genetic data from the cases and determined that the same strain that sparked the outbreak last October has continued to spread, surpassing the 12-month threshold. Although transmission has slowed, the virus is still spreading. There were 23 cases identified in the week of October 26 to November 1.",

    "text": "The heads of Apple TV have “no plans” to bring ads to the streaming service, balking, at least for now, at a strategy that has driven success for Apple’s streaming rivals.\n\nIn its November 2025 issue, British movie magazine Screen International asked Eddy Cue, senior vice president of Apple Services, if there are plans to launch an ad-based subscription tier for Apple TV. Cue responded:\n\nNothing at this time. … I don’t want to say no forever, but there are no plans. If we can stay aggressive with our pricing, it’s better for consumers not to get interrupted with ads.\n\nThe comments follow reports over the years suggesting that Apple has been seeking knowledge on how to build a streaming ads business. Most recently, The Telegraph reported that Apple TV executives met with the United Kingdom’s ratings body, Barb, to discuss what tracking ads on Apple TV would look like. In 2023, Apple hired advertising exec Lauren Fry as head of video and Apple News ad sales.\n\nFor Apple, “aggressive” pricing has meant three price hikes since Apple TV’s 2019 launch and a current monthly subscription fee of $13. For comparison, Netflix starts at $18 per month without ads, and Disney+ is $19/month without ads.\n\nIntroducing ads seems like a natural progression for Apple TV, not only because that’s what the competition is doing, but also because Apple TV reportedly doesn’t make money. Cue and the other Apple executives interviewed for Screen International’s article didn’t discuss revenue or profits or specify how many subscribers Apple TV has (Cue did say that Apple TV is “growing faster” and has more viewers with “more viewing hours in this past year than” ever before). In March, The Information, citing two anonymous people “with direct knowledge of the matter,” reported that Apple TV costs Apple $1 billion per year. The publication’s sources claimed the service had about 45 million subscribers.",

The d7vk project describes itself as “a Vulkan-based translation layer for Direct3D 7 [D3D7], which allows running 3D applications on Linux using Wine.”\n\nMore options are always welcome\n\nThe new project isn’t the first attempt to get Direct3D 7 games running on Linux. Wine‘s own built-in WineD3D compatibility layer has supported D3D7 in some form or another for at least two decades now. But the new d7vk project instead branches off the existing dxvk compatibility layer, which is already used by Valve’s Proton for SteamOS and which reportedly offers better performance than WineD3D on many games.\n\nD7vk project author WinterSnowfall writes that while they don’t expect this new project to be upstreamed into the main dxvk in the future, the new version should have “the same level of per application/targeted configuration profiles and fixes that you’re used to seeing in dxvk proper.” And though d7vk might not perform universally better than the existing alternatives, WinterSnowfall writes that “having more options on the table is a good thing in my book at least.”",

    "text": "A new simulation could help solve one of astronomy’s longstanding mysteries—how supermassive black holes formed so rapidly—along with a new one: What are the James Webb Space Telescope’s (JWST) “little red dots?”\n\nInvisible leviathans lurk at the cores of nearly all of the 2 trillion or so galaxies strewn throughout space-time. Monster black holes entered the cosmic scene soon after the Universe’s birth and grew rapidly, reaching millions or even billions of times the Sun’s mass in less than a billion years. Astronomers have long wondered how these supermassive black holes could have grown so hefty in such little time.\n\nThe monster black hole mystery became even more perplexing in 2022 when “little red dots” were spotted at the far edges of space. When these tiny scarlet orbs began unexpectedly popping up in JWST images of the distant Universe, their nature was hotly debated. Now that scientists have amassed a sample of hundreds of them, many think the dots are growing supermassive black holes.\n\nThe problem is that they appear even earlier than astronomers thought possible, making the challenge of explaining early supermassive black holes even harder. Observations suggest that the little red dots mainly flickered on when the Universe was around 600 million years old and fizzled out within the next billion years (the supermassive black holes linger to the present time, but they no longer light up as little red dots).\n\nA new study tries to explain the early formation of these immense objects via swelling swarms of stars.\n\nMissing link\n\nMany people thought it would violate the laws of physics for monster black holes to form so quickly. But a new study explains how colliding clusters of stars could have given rise to supermassive black holes within the Universe’s first several hundred million years—no new physics required.\n\n“Right now, there are three main ideas for how supermassive black hole seeds form: direct collapse from gas clouds, remnants of the first stars, and dense star clusters,” said Fred Garcia, a graduate student at Columbia University who led the study. “Our work really supports the last case, where dense clusters evolve and their centers collapse to make intermediate-mass black hole seeds.”",

    "text": "It’s shaping up to be an excellent season for Stephen King adaptations. In September, we got The Long Walk, an excellent (though harrowing) adaptation of King’s 1979 Richard Bachman novel. Last month, HBO debuted its new series IT: Welcome to Derry, which explores the mythology and origins of Pennywise the killer clown. And this Friday is the premiere of The Running Man, director Edgar Wright’s (Shaun of the Dead, Baby Driver, Last Night in Soho) take on King’s novel of the same name. So naturally Paramount has released a final trailer to lure us to the theater.\n\nAs previously reported, the 1987 action film starring Schwarzenegger was only loosely based on King’s novel, preserving the basic concept and very little else in favor of more sci-fi gadgetry and high-octane action. It was a noisy, entertaining romp—and very late ’80s—but it lacked King’s subtler satirical tone. Wright expressed interest in adapting his own version of The Running Man in 2017, and Paramount greenlit the project four years later. Wright and co-screenwriter Michael Bacall envisioned their film as less of a remake and more of a faithful adaptation of King’s original novel. (We’ll see if that faithfulness extends to the novel’s bleak ending.)\n\nPer the official premise:\n\nIn a near-future society, The Running Man is the top-rated show on television—a deadly competition where contestants, known as Runners, must survive 30 days while being hunted by professional assassins, with every move broadcast to a bloodthirsty public and each day bringing a greater cash reward. Desperate to save his sick daughter, working-class Ben Richards (Glen Powell) is convinced by the show’s charming but ruthless producer, Dan Killian (Josh Brolin), to enter the game as a last resort. But Ben’s defiance, instincts, and grit turn him into an unexpected fan favorite—and a threat to the entire system. As ratings skyrocket, so does the danger, and Ben must outwit not just the Hunters, but a nation addicted to watching him fall.\n\nIn addition to Powell and Brolin, the cast includes Lee Pace as lead Hunter Evan McCone; Jayme Lawson as Ben’s wife, Sheila; Colman Domingo as Bobby Thompson, game show host; Michael Cera as the rebel Bradley Throckmorton; William H. Macy as a man who aids Ben; David Zayas as Richard Manuel; Emilia Jones as Amelia, a hostage civilian; Karl Glusman as a Hunter; and Katy O’Brian and Daniel Ezra as two other contestants on the show.",

More formally called the Autodromo Jose Carlos Pace, it’s definitely one of the more old-school circuits that F1 visits—and invariably one of the more dramatic.\n\nFor one thing, it’s anything but billiard-smooth. Better yet, there’s elevation—lots of it—and cambers, too. Unlike most F1 tracks, it runs counterclockwise, and it combines some very fast sections with several rather technical corners that can catch out even the best drivers in the world. Nestled between a couple of lakes in São Paulo, weather is also a regular factor in races here. And indeed, a severe weather warning was issued in the lead-up to this weekend’s race.\n\nYou have to hit the ground running\n\nThis was another sprint weekend, which means that instead of two practice sessions on Friday and another on Saturday morning, the teams get one on Friday, then go into qualifying for the Saturday sprint race. The shortened testing time tends to shake things up a bit, and we definitely saw that this weekend.\n\nWhen we left Mexico, there was only a point’s difference between McLaren drivers Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri in the championship. After a strong run in the middle of the season, when he led the championship and seemed to have the edge on Norris, Piastri has had a string of disappointing races. By recent standards, Brazil wasn’t quite so bad, but it wasn’t great, either.\n\nIs it just me, or does Williams usually have a disappointing weekend when it does a Gulf Oil livery? Credit: Alessio Morgese/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nDespite the weather warnings, none of the sessions required treaded tires. While the track surface was basically dry for the sprint race, the same couldn’t be said for the painted curbs—water had collected in the valleys between the stepped “teeth,” and as just about every racer knows, if the painted bits of the track are wet, you really don’t want to go near them if you have slick tires.",

    "text": "After a long summer and fall of uncertainty, private astronaut Jared Isaacman has been renominated to lead NASA, and there appears to be momentum behind getting him confirmed quickly as the space agency’s 15th administrator. It is possible, although far from a lock, the Senate could finalize his nomination before the end of this year.\n\nIt cannot happen soon enough.\n\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration is, to put it bluntly, kind of a mess. This is not meant to disparage the many fine people who work at NASA. But years of neglect, changing priorities, mismanagement, creeping bureaucracy, meeting bloat, and other factors have taken their toll. NASA is still capable of doing great things. It still inspires. But it needs a fresh start.\n\n“Jared has already garnered tremendous support from nearly everyone in the space community,” said Lori Garver, who served as NASA’s deputy administrator under President Obama. “This should give him a tail wind as he inevitably will have to make tough calls.”\n\nGarver worked for a Democratic administration, and it’s notable that Isaacman has admirers from across the political spectrum, from left-leaning space advocates to right-wing influencers. A decade and a half ago, Garver led efforts to get NASA to more fully embrace commercial space. In some ways, Isaacman will seek to further this legacy, and Garver knows all too well how difficult it is to change the sprawling space agency and beat back entrenched contractors.\n\n“Expectations are high, yet the challenge of marrying outsized goals to greatly reduced budget guidance from his administration remains,” Garver said. “It will be difficult to deliver on accelerating Artemis, transitioning to commercial LEO destinations, starting a serious nuclear electric propulsion program for Mars transportation, and attracting non-government funding for science missions. He’s coming in with a lot of support, which he will need in the current divisive political environment.”",

    "text": "Blue Origin scrubbed Sunday’s launch attempt due to poor weather, a cruise ship in restricted waters near the launch site, and ground system issues. The company says the next available launch opportunity is Wednesday, November 12, with a window opening at 2:50 pm EST (19:50 UTC).\n\nCAPE CANAVERAL, Florida—The field of astrodynamics isn’t a magical discipline, but sometimes it seems like trajectory analysts can pull a solution out of a hat.\n\nThat’s what it took to save NASA’s ESCAPADE mission from a lengthy delay, and possible cancellation, after its rocket wasn’t ready to send it toward Mars during its appointed launch window last year. ESCAPADE, short for Escape and Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers, consists of two identical spacecraft setting off for the red planet as soon as Sunday with a launch aboard Blue Origin’s massive New Glenn rocket.\n\n“ESCAPADE is pursuing a very unusual trajectory in getting to Mars,” said Rob Lillis, from the University of California, Berkeley and the mission’s principal investigator. “We’re launching outside the typical Hohmann transfer windows, which occur every 25 or 26 months. We are using a very flexible mission design approach where we go into a loiter orbit around Earth in order to sort of wait until Earth and Mars are lined up correctly in November of next year to go to Mars.”\n\nThis wasn’t the original plan. When it was first designed, ESCAPADE was supposed to take a direct course from Earth to Mars, a transit that typically takes six to nine months. But ESCAPADE will now depart the Earth when Mars is more than 220 million miles away, on the opposite side of the Solar System.\n\nThe payload fairing of Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket, containing NASA’s two Mars-bound science probes. Credit: Blue Origin\n\nThe most recent Mars launch window was last year, and the next one doesn’t come until the end of 2026. The planets are not currently in alignment, and the proverbial stars didn’t align to get the ESCAPADE satellites and their New Glenn rocket to the launch pad until this weekend.\n\nThis is fine\n\nBut there are several reasons this is perfectly OK to NASA. The New Glenn rocket is overkill for this mission. The two-stage launcher could send many tons of cargo to Mars, but NASA is only asking it to dispatch about a ton of payload, comprising a pair of identical science probes designed to study how the planet’s upper atmosphere interacts with the solar wind.\n\nBut NASA got a good deal from Blue Origin. The space agency is paying Jeff Bezos’ space company about $20 million for the launch, less than it would for a dedicated launch on any other rocket capable of sending the ESCAPADE mission to Mars. In exchange, NASA is accepting a greater than usual chance of a launch failure. This is, after all, just the second flight of the 321-foot-tall (98-meter) New Glenn rocket, which hasn’t yet been certified by NASA or the US Space Force.",

    "text": "Blue Origin stands ready to help NASA achieve its goals with regard to landing humans on the Moon as soon as possible, the company’s chief executive said Saturday in an interview with Ars.\n\n“We just want to help the US get to the Moon,” said Dave Limp, CEO of the space company founded by Jeff Bezos. “If NASA wants to go quicker, we would move heaven and Earth, pun intended, to try to get to the Moon sooner. And I think we have some good ideas.”\n\nLimp spoke on Saturday, about 24 hours ahead of the company’s second launch of the large New Glenn rocket. Carrying the ESCAPADE spacecraft for NASA, the mission has a launch window that opens at 2:45 pm ET (19:45 UTC) at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida and runs for a little more than two hours.\n\nNASA seeks a faster return\n\nThis year it has become increasingly apparent that, should NASA stick to its present plans for the Artemis III lunar landing mission, China is on course to beat the United States back to the Moon with humans. In recognition of this, about three weeks ago, NASA acting administrator Sean Duffy said the space agency was reopening the competition for a human lander.\n\nSpaceX and Blue Origin both have existing contracts for human landers, but the government has asked each provider for an option to accelerate their timeline. NASA currently has a target landing date of 2027, but that is unrealistic using the present approach of SpaceX’s Starship or Blue Origin’s large Mk. 2 lander.\n\nArs exclusively reported in early October that Blue Origin had begun work on a faster architecture, involving multiple versions of its Mk. 1 cargo lander as well as a modified version of this vehicle, tentatively called Mk 1.5. Limp said that after Duffy asked for revised proposals, Blue Origin responded almost immediately.\n\n“We’ve sent our initial summary of that over, and we have a full report of that due here shortly,” he said. “I’m not going to go into the details because I think that’s probably for NASA to talk about, not us, but we have some ideas that we think could accelerate the path to the Moon. And I hope NASA takes a close look.”",

He had previously been hospitalized with an infection. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory also confirmed his passing.\n\nWatson was born in Chicago in 1928 and attained scientific fame in 1953 at 25 years old for solving the molecular structure of DNA—the genetic blueprints for life—with his colleague Francis Crick at England’s Cavendish laboratory. Their discovery heavily relied on the work of chemist and crystallographer Rosalind Franklin at King’s College in London, whose X-ray images of DNA provided critical clues to the molecule’s twisted-ladder-like architecture. One image in particular from Franklin’s lab, Photo 51, made Watson and Crick’s discovery possible. But, she was not fully credited for her contribution. The image was given to Watson and Crick without Franklin’s knowledge or consent by Maurice Wilkins, a biophysicist and colleague of Franklin.\n\nWatson, Crick, and Wilkins were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1962 for the discovery of DNA’s structure. By that time, Franklin had died (she died in 1958 at the age of 37 from ovarian cancer), and Nobels are not given posthumously. But Watson and Crick’s treatment of Franklin and her research has generated lasting scorn within the scientific community. Throughout his career and in his memoir, Watson disparaged Franklin’s intelligence and appearance.",

    "text": "The next time you encounter an unusually polite reply on social media, you might want to check twice. It could be an AI model trying (and failing) to blend in with the crowd.\n\nOn Wednesday, researchers from the University of Zurich, University of Amsterdam, Duke University, and New York University released a study revealing that AI models remain easily distinguishable from humans in social media conversations, with overly friendly emotional tone serving as the most persistent giveaway. The research, which tested nine open-weight models across Twitter/X, Bluesky, and Reddit, found that classifiers developed by the researchers detected AI-generated replies with 70 to 80 percent accuracy.\n\nThe study introduces what the authors call a “computational Turing test” to assess how closely AI models approximate human language. Instead of relying on subjective human judgment about whether text sounds authentic, the framework uses automated classifiers and linguistic analysis to identify specific features that distinguish machine-generated from human-authored content.\n\n“Even after calibration, LLM outputs remain clearly distinguishable from human text, particularly in affective tone and emotional expression,” the researchers wrote. The team, led by Nicolò Pagan at the University of Zurich, tested various optimization strategies, from simple prompting to fine-tuning, but found that deeper emotional cues persist as reliable tells that a particular text interaction online was authored by an AI chatbot rather than a human.\n\nThe toxicity tell\n\nIn the study, researchers tested nine large language models: Llama 3.1 8B, Llama 3.1 8B Instruct, Llama 3.1 70B, Mistral 7B v0.1, Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2, Qwen 2.5 7B Instruct, Gemma 3 4B Instruct, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, and Apertus-8B-2509.\n\nWhen prompted to generate replies to real social media posts from actual users, the AI models struggled to match the level of casual negativity and spontaneous emotional expression common in human social media posts, with toxicity scores consistently lower than authentic human replies across all three platforms.\n\nTo counter this deficiency, the researchers attempted optimization strategies (including providing writing examples and context retrieval) that reduced structural differences like sentence length or word count, but variations in emotional tone persisted. “Our comprehensive calibration tests challenge the assumption that more sophisticated optimization necessarily yields more human-like output,” the researchers concluded.",

Researchers at Unit 42, the threat intelligence arm of Palo Alto Networks, have revealed a sophisticated spyware known as “Landfall” targeting Samsung Galaxy phones. The researchers say this campaign leveraged a zero-day exploit in Samsung Android software to steal a raft of personal data, and it was active for almost a year. Thankfully, the underlying vulnerability has now been patched, and the attacks were most likely targeted at specific groups.\n\nUnit 42 says that Landfall first appeared in July 2024, relying on a software flaw now catalogued as CVE-2025-21042. Samsung issued a patch for its phones in April 2025, but details of the attack have only been revealed now.\n\nEven if you were out there poking around the darker corners of the Internet in 2024 and early 2025 with a Samsung Galaxy device, it’s unlikely you’d be infected. The team believes Landfall was used in the Middle East to target individuals for surveillance. It is currently unclear who was behind the attacks.\n\nLandfall is particularly devious because it’s what’s known as a zero-click attack, which can compromise a system without the user’s direct involvement. Unit 42 only spotted Landfall because of two similar bugs that were patched in Apple iOS and WhatsApp. When combined, these two exploits would enable remote code execution, so the team went looking for exploits that might do that. They found several malicious image files uploaded to VirusTotal that revealed the Landfall attack.\n\nImages that aren’t just images\n\nA traditional image file is non-executable, but certain image files can be malformed in a way that carries malicious code. In the case of Landfall, the attackers used modified DNG files, a type of raw file based on the TIFF format. Within these DNG files, the unknown threat actors had embedded ZIP archives with malicious payloads.",

    "text": "The federal government shutdown, now in its 38th day, prompted the Federal Aviation Administration to issue a temporary emergency order Thursday prohibiting commercial rocket launches from occurring during “peak hours” of air traffic.\n\nThe FAA also directed commercial airlines to reduce domestic flights from 40 “high impact airports” across the country in a phased approach beginning Friday. The agency said the order from the FAA’s administrator, Bryan Bedford, is aimed at addressing “safety risks and delays presented by air traffic controller staffing constraints caused by the continued lapse in appropriations.”\n\nThe government considers air traffic controllers essential workers, so they remain on the job without pay until Congress passes a federal budget and President Donald Trump signs it into law. The shutdown’s effects, which affected federal workers most severely at first, are now rippling across the broader economy.\n\nSharing the airspace\n\nVehicles traveling to and from space share the skies with aircraft, requiring close coordination with air traffic controllers to clear airspace for rocket launches and reentries. The FAA said its order restricting commercial air traffic, launches, and reentries is intended to “ensure the safety of aircraft and the efficiency of the [National Airspace System].”\n\nIn a statement explaining the order, the FAA said the air traffic control system is “stressed” due to the shutdown.\n\n“With continued delays and unpredictable staffing shortages, which are driving fatigue, risk is further increasing, and the FAA is concerned with the system’s ability to maintain the current volume of operations,” the regulator said. “Accordingly, the FAA has determined additional mitigation is necessary.”\n\nBeginning Monday, the FAA said commercial space launches will only be permitted between 10 pm and 6 am local time, when the national airspace is most calm. The order restricts commercial reentries to the same overnight timeframe. The FAA licenses all commercial launches and reentries.",

    "text": "Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) has a ‘for sale’ sign up. And that could mean big changes for subscribers to the company’s most popular streaming service, HBO Max.\n\nAfter receiving unsolicited acquisition offers, WBD recently declared itself open to “strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value.” WBD drew new attention by being open to selling its streaming business (WBD is also still open to moving forward with previously shared plans to split into a cable company and a streaming and movie studios company next year).\n\nNaturally, mergers and acquisitions talk has heated up since then, with Paramount as one of the most eager suitors. Paramount, which merged with Skydance in August, is reportedly planning to keep “much of Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. intact” if a deal happens, per a Bloomberg report that cited unnamed people familiar with the plans of David Ellison, Paramount’s CEO.\n\nFor HBO Max subscribers, the most pertinent part of Bloomberg’s report follows:\n\nUnder Ellison’s plan, Warner Bros.’ HBO Max streaming service would merge into the existing Paramount+ platform, one of the people said. He believes combining the offerings will allow more people to see the work of film and TV show creators. The libraries of the two companies will make Paramount+ more compelling for subscribers.\n\nThe purported strategy would likely end the ability to subscribe to HBO Max in favor of the opportunity to pay for a beefier version of Paramount+.\n\nHigher prices are possible\n\nChoice is typically seen as good for consumers. But in the case of streaming, which only recently overtook broadcast and cable viewing, the recent expansion of services available is often viewed negatively. Streaming fragmentation forces people to jump from service to service in order to find something to watch and to pay for more subscriptions.",

But questions linger about the significance of the deal.\n\nAccording to the announcement, Medicare and state Medicaid programs will be able to purchase a month’s supply of Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, and Zepbound at $245 each for eligible patients. Eligible people on Medicare will have a $50 co-pay.\n\nThe negotiated price is a significant cut from the drugs’ list prices: The list price for Ozempic is $997, Wegovy is $1,350, Mounjaro is $1,080, and Zepbound is $1,086. But, of course, purchasers rarely pay drug list prices. It’s unclear how much Medicare and Medicaid would have paid for the drugs without this deal and what the savings will be.\n\nIt’s also unclear how many people in these federal programs will gain access to the new drugs and their negotiated prices. Federal programs currently are prohibited from covering any drugs intended for “weight loss.” The Biden administration proposed reinterpreting a federal rule to allow coverage of drugs specifically for the treatment of obesity. That change would have allowed 3.4 million people on Medicare and about 4 million on Medicaid to gain access to the drugs. But the Trump administration rejected the change.\n\nThe administration told reporters that the new drug pricing would be available to patients on Medicare and Medicaid who met specific conditions. The drugs at their new prices will be available to the following: those with a body mass index (BMI) over 27 who have also been diagnosed as pre-diabetic or have had a stroke, myocardial infarction, or peripheral artery disease; those with a BMI over 30 who also have stage-three kidney disease or other qualifying comorbidities; and those with a BMI over 35.",

But starting this September, odd queries, sometimes more than 300 characters long, could also be found in GSC. Showing only user inputs, the chats appeared to be from unwitting people prompting a chatbot to help solve relationship or business problems, who likely expected those conversations would remain private.\n\nJason Packer, owner of an analytics consulting firm called Quantable, was among the first to flag the issue in a detailed blog last month.\n\nDetermined to figure out what exactly was causing the leaks, he teamed up with “Internet sleuth” and web optimization consultant Slobodan Manić. Together, they conducted testing that they believe may have surfaced “the first definitive proof that OpenAI directly scrapes Google Search with actual user prompts.” Their investigation seemed to confirm the AI giant was compromising user privacy, in some cases in order to maintain engagement by seizing search data that Google otherwise wouldn’t share.\n\nOpenAI declined Ars’ request to confirm if Packer and Manić’s theory posed in their blog was correct or answer any of their remaining questions that could help users determine the scope of the problem.\n\nHowever, an OpenAI spokesperson confirmed that the company was “aware” of the issue and has since “resolved” a glitch “that temporarily affected how a small number of search queries were routed.”\n\nPacker told Ars that he’s “very pleased that OpenAI was able to resolve the issue quickly.” But he suggested that OpenAI’s response failed to confirm whether or not OpenAI was scraping Google, and that leaves room for doubt that the issue was completely resolved.",
